Overview

Version: 0.1.0

Status: Draft

AITP is a spec in progress and we are open to comments, feedback, and contributions!

We are simultaneously writing this spec, integrating AITP support into the
NEAR AI Hub
, and building
AITP-compatible
agents
to inform how the protocol should change before v1.0.

Introduction
​

AITP enables AI agents to communicate securely across trust boundaries while providing extensible mechanisms for structured interactions.

Imagine this scenario:
You ask your AI assistant to book a flight to Miami. Instead of your assistant needing to navigate airline websites, it can directly communicate with airline booking agents using a standardized protocol. Your assistant and the airline agent exchange structured data about flight options, passenger details, and payment information—all using the same protocol regardless of which airline you choose.

Key Benefits of AITP:

Universal Communication
: Any AITP-compatible agents can interact, regardless of who built them
Structured Data Exchange
: Beyond just text, agents can share UI elements, forms, and payment requests
Trust Boundary Crossing
: Secure interaction between agents representing different entities
Extensible Capabilities
: New interaction types can be added through the capability system

We envision a future in which most online interactions are conducted by AI agents representing people, businesses, and government entities, communicating with users and with each other. These agents will combine the scale and cost benefits of current online services with the flexibility and personalization of human interactions. Just as HTTP and HTML enable any web browser to visit any website, AITP provides a standard for agent-to-agent and user-to-agent communication, regardless of where those agents run or how they're built.

For a deeper exploration of the problems AITP aims to solve and our vision for the future of agent interactions, see the
Vision
page.

Protocol Overview
​

AITP consists of two pieces:

A core protocol for communicating with agents in
Chat Threads
, inspired by and largely compatible with the OpenAI Assistant/Threads API.  Read more about:
Why Threads?
Thread Transports
Thread Specification
An extensible set of
Capabilities
communicated over those chat threads to indicate that the client of an agent (i.e. a user interface or another agent) can support useful standardized features like multimodal input, generative UI, payments, and/or human-in-the-loop attestations.  Read more about:

These components work together: agents communicate via
Threads
, which are transmitted using a
Transport
, and exchange structured data using
Capabilities
when needed for specific operations.

AITP vs...
​

Protocol Type
Purpose
When to Use
AITP Relationship
Multi-agent orchestration
(CrewAI, Autogen, LangGraph)
Coordinate agents with same owner
Internal agent workflows
Complementary - can use for internal orchestration while using AITP for external communication
Service metadata protocols
(MCP, Bitte, llms.txt)
Help agents use existing APIs
Accessing traditional services
Complementary - service agents may use MCP internally while offering AITP externally
Browser use agents
(ChatGPT Operator, Proxy, Rabbit LAM)
Navigate existing websites
Bridging to current web
Transitional - useful until AITP adoption grows

While these frameworks and AITP all involve agent communication, AITP specifically addresses interactions across trust boundaries, like a user's agent talking to a business's agent.

There's lots more on this subject on the
Vision
page.

Join our Telegram community
:
https://t.me/nearaialpha
Build more agents
: The more AITP-compatible agents there are, the more useful each agent will be.  Agents built on the
NEAR AI Hub
support all AITP features.
Build AITP support into more AI agent frameworks and clients
: We want every AI agent framework, hosting provider, and chat UI to support AITP.
Contribute to the protocol
: open an issue, pull request, or discussion on the
AITP repo
.

If you're using AI development aids, the latest specification has been packaged up into
aitp-repomix.txt
, perfect for adding to your AI's context so it knows how to use AITP.
