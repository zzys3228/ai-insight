Abstract

Decentralized identifiers

(DIDs) are a new type of identifier that
enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A

DID

refers to any
subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.)
as determined by the controller of the

DID

. In contrast to
typical, federated identifiers,

DIDs

have been designed so that they may
be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate
authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the
discovery of information related to a

DID

, the design enables the
controller of a

DID

to prove control over it without requiring permission
from any other party.

DIDs

are

URIs

that associate a

DID
subject

with a

DID document

allowing trustable interactions
associated with that subject.

Each

DID document

can express cryptographic material,

verification
methods

, or

services

, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a

DID controller

to prove control of the

DID

.

Services

enable
trusted interactions associated with the

DID subject

. A

DID

might
provide the means to return the

DID subject

itself, if the

DID
subject

is an information resource such as a data model.

This document specifies the DID syntax, a common data model, core properties,
serialized representations, DID operations, and an explanation of the process
of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent.

Introduction

This section is non-normative.

As individuals and organizations, many of us use globally unique identifiers in
a wide variety of contexts. They serve as communications addresses (telephone
numbers, email addresses, usernames on social media), ID numbers (for passports,
drivers licenses, tax IDs, health insurance), and product identifiers (serial
numbers, barcodes, RFIDs). URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) are used for
resources on the Web and each web page you view in a browser has a globally
unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator).

The vast majority of these globally unique identifiers are not under our
control. They are issued by external authorities that decide who or what they
refer to and when they can be revoked. They are useful only in certain contexts
and recognized only by certain bodies not of our choosing. They might
disappear or cease to be valid with the failure of an organization. They might
unnecessarily reveal personal information. In many cases, they can be
fraudulently replicated and asserted by a malicious third-party, which is
more commonly known as "identity theft".

The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) defined in this specification are a new
type of globally unique identifier. They are designed to enable individuals and
organizations to generate their own identifiers using systems they trust. These
new identifiers enable entities to prove control over them by authenticating
using cryptographic proofs such as digital signatures.

Since the generation and assertion of Decentralized Identifiers is
entity-controlled, each entity can have as many DIDs as necessary to maintain
their desired separation of identities, personas, and interactions. The use of
these identifiers can be scoped appropriately to different contexts. They
support interactions with other people, institutions, or systems that require
entities to identify themselves, or things they control, while providing control
over how much personal or private data should be revealed, all without depending
on a central authority to guarantee the continued existence of the identifier.
These ideas are explored in the DID Use Cases document [

DID-USE-CASES

].

This specification does not presuppose any particular technology or cryptography
to underpin the generation, persistence, resolution, or interpretation of DIDs.
For example, implementers can create Decentralized Identifiers based on
identifiers registered in federated or centralized identity management systems.
Indeed, almost all types of identifier systems can add support for DIDs. This
creates an interoperability bridge between the worlds of centralized, federated,
and decentralized identifiers. This also enables implementers to design specific
types of DIDs to work with the computing infrastructure they trust, such as
distributed ledgers, decentralized file systems, distributed databases, and
peer-to-peer networks.

This specification is for:

Anyone that wants to understand the core architectural principles that
are the foundation for Decentralized Identifiers;

Software developers that want to produce and consume Decentralized Identifiers
and their associated data formats;

Systems integrators that want to understand how to use Decentralized
Identifiers in their software and hardware systems;

Specification authors that want to create new DID infrastructures, known as DID
methods, that conform to the ecosystem described by this document.

In addition to this specification, readers might find the
Use Cases and Requirements for Decentralized Identifiers [

DID-USE-CASES

]
document useful.

1.1

A Simple Example

This section is non-normative.

A

DID

is a simple text string consisting of three parts: 1) the

did

URI scheme identifier, 2) the identifier for the

DID
method

, and 3) the DID method-specific identifier.

Figure

A simple example of a decentralized identifier (DID)

The example

DID

above resolves to a

DID document

. A

DID
document

contains information associated with the

DID

, such as ways
to cryptographically

authenticate

a

DID controller

.

Design Goals

This section is non-normative.

Decentralized Identifiers

are a component of larger systems, such as the
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem [

VC-DATA-MODEL

], which influenced the design
goals for this specification. The design goals for Decentralized Identifiers
are summarized here.

Goal

Description

Decentralization

Eliminate the requirement for centralized authorities or single point failure in
identifier management, including the registration of globally unique
identifiers, public verification keys,

services

, and other information.

Control

Give entities, both human and non-human, the power to directly control their
digital identifiers without the need to rely on external authorities.

Privacy

Enable entities to control the privacy of their information, including minimal,
selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or other data.

Security

Enable sufficient security for requesting parties to depend on

DID
documents

for their required level of assurance.

Proof-based

Enable

DID controllers

to provide cryptographic proof when interacting
with other entities.

Discoverability

Make it possible for entities to discover

DIDs

for other entities, to
learn more about or interact with those entities.

Interoperability

Use interoperable standards so

DID

infrastructure can make use of
existing tools and software libraries designed for interoperability.

Portability

Be system- and network-independent and enable entities to use their digital
identifiers with any system that supports

DIDs

and

DID methods

.

Simplicity

Favor a reduced set of simple features to make the technology easier to
understand, implement, and deploy.

Extensibility

Where possible, enable extensibility provided it does not greatly hinder
interoperability, portability, or simplicity.

1.3

Six internally-labeled shapes appear in the diagram, with labeled arrows
between them, as follows. In the center of the diagram is a rectangle labeled
DID URL, containing small typewritten text "did:example:123/path/to/rsrc". At
the center top of the diagram is a rectangle labeled, "DID", containing small
typewritten text "did:example:123". At the top left of the diagram is an oval,
labeled "DID Subject". At the bottom center of the diagram is a rectangle
labeled, "DID document". At the bottom left is an oval, labeled, "DID

"DID" rectangle, labeled "recorded on", points downards to the right, to the
"Verifiable Data Registry" cylinder. An arrow from the "DID document" rectangle,
labeled "recorded on", points upwards to the right to the "Verifiable Data
Registry" cylinder.

DIDs and DID URLs

A Decentralized Identifier, or

DID

, is a

URI

composed of three
parts: the scheme

did:

, a method identifier, and a unique,
method-specific identifier specified by the

DID method

.

DIDs

are
resolvable to

DID documents

. A

DID URL

extends the syntax of a
basic

DID

to incorporate other standard

URI

components such as
path, query, and fragment in order to locate a particular

resource

—for example, a cryptographic public key inside a

DID
document

, or a

resource

external to the

DID document

.
These concepts are elaborated upon in

3.1

DID Syntax

and

3.2

DID URL Syntax

.

DID subjects

The subject of a

DID

is, by definition, the entity identified by the

DID

. The

DID subject

might also be the

DID controller

.
Anything can be the subject of a

DID

: person, group, organization,
thing, or concept. This is further defined in

5.1.1

DID Subject

.

DID controllers

The

controller

of a

DID

is the entity (person, organization, or
autonomous software) that has the capability—as defined by a

DID
method

—to make changes to a

DID document

. This capability is
typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by
software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted
via other mechanisms. Note that a

DID

might have more than one
controller, and the

DID subject

can be the

DID controller

, or one
of them. This concept is documented in

5.1.2

DID Controller

.

Verifiable data registries

In order to be resolvable to

DID documents

,

DIDs

are typically
recorded on an underlying system or network of some kind. Regardless of the
specific technology used, any such system that supports recording

DIDs

and returning data necessary to produce

DID documents

is called a

verifiable data registry

. Examples include

distributed ledgers

,
decentralized file systems, databases of any kind, peer-to-peer networks, and
other forms of trusted data storage. This concept is further elaborated upon in

8.

Methods

.

DID documents

DID documents

contain information associated with a

DID

. They
typically express

verification methods

, such as cryptographic public
keys, and

services

relevant to interactions with the

DID subject

.
The generic properties supported in a

DID document

are specified in

5.

Core Properties

. A

DID document

can be serialized to a byte
stream (see

6.

Representations

). The properties present in
a

DID document

can be updated according to the applicable operations
outlined in

8.

Methods

.

DID methods

DID methods

are the mechanism by which a particular type of

DID

and its associated

DID document

are created, resolved, updated, and
deactivated.

DID methods

are defined using separate DID method
specifications as defined in

8.

Methods

.

DID resolvers and DID resolution

A

DID resolver

is a system component that takes a

DID

as input and
produces a conforming

DID document

as output. This process is called

DID resolution

. The steps for resolving a specific type of

DID

are
defined by the relevant

DID method

specification. The process of

DID
resolution

is elaborated upon in

7.

Resolution

.

DID URL dereferencers and DID URL dereferencing

A

DID URL dereferencer

is a system component that takes a

DID URL

as input and produces a

resource

as output. This process is
called

DID URL dereferencing

. The process of

DID URL dereferencing

is elaborated upon in

7.2

DID URL Dereferencing

.

]
        when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This document contains examples that contain JSON and JSON-LD content.
Some of these examples contain characters that are invalid, such as inline
comments (

//

) and the use of ellipsis (

...

) to denote
information that adds little value to the example. Implementers are cautioned to
remove this content if they desire to use the information as valid JSON
or JSON-LD.

Some examples contain terms, both property names and values, that are not
defined in this specification. These are indicated with a comment (

//
external (property name|value)

). Such terms, when used in a

DID
document

, are expected to be registered in the DID Specification Registries
[

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

] with links to both a formal definition and a JSON-LD
context.

Interoperability of implementations for

DIDs

and

DID documents

is
tested by evaluating an implementation's ability to create and parse

DIDs

and

DID documents

that conform to this specification. Interoperability
for producers and consumers of

DIDs

and

DID documents

is provided
by ensuring the

DIDs

and

DID documents

conform. Interoperability
for

DID method

specifications is provided by the details in each

DID
method

specification. It is understood that, in the same way that a web
browser is not required to implement all known

URI

schemes, conformant
software that works with

DIDs

is not required to implement all known

DID methods

. However, all implementations of a given

DID method

are expected to be interoperable for that method.

A

conforming DID

is any concrete expression of the rules specified in

3.

Identifier

which complies with relevant normative statements in
that section.

A

conforming DID document

is any concrete expression of the data
model described in this specification which complies with the relevant normative
statements in

4.

Data Model

and

5.

Core Properties

. A
serialization format for the conforming document is deterministic,
bi-directional, and lossless, as described in

6.

A

conforming producer

is any algorithm realized as software and/or
hardware that generates

conforming DIDs

or

conforming DID
Documents

and complies with the relevant normative statements in

is any algorithm realized as software and/or
hardware that consumes

conforming DIDs

or

Terminology

This section is non-normative.

This section defines the terms used in this specification and throughout

decentralized identifier

infrastructure. A link to these terms is
included whenever they appear in this specification.

amplification attack

A class of attack where the attacker attempts to exhaust a target system's
CPU, storage, network, or other resources by providing small, valid inputs into
the system that result in damaging effects that can be exponentially more costly
to process than the inputs themselves.

authenticate

Authentication is a process by which an entity can prove it has a specific
attribute or controls a specific secret using one or more

verification
methods

. With

DIDs

, a common example would be proving control of the
cryptographic private key associated with a public key published in a

DID
document

.

cryptographic suite

A specification defining the usage of specific cryptographic primitives in
order to achieve a particular security goal. These documents are often used
to specify

verification methods

, digital signature types,
their identifiers, and other related properties.

decentralized identifier

(DID)

A globally unique persistent identifier that does not require a centralized
registration authority and is often generated and/or registered
cryptographically. The generic format of a DID is defined in

3.1

DID Syntax

. A specific

DID scheme

is defined in a

DID
method

specification. Many—but not all—DID methods make use of

distributed ledger technology

(DLT) or some other form of decentralized
network.

decentralized identity management

Identity
management

that is based on the use of

decentralized identifiers

.
Decentralized identity management extends authority for identifier generation,
registration, and assignment beyond traditional roots of trust such as

X.500 directory services

,
the

Domain Name System

,
and most national ID systems.

DID controller

An entity that has the capability to make changes to a

DID document

. A

DID

might have more than one DID controller. The DID controller(s)
can be denoted by the optional

controller

property at the top level of the

DID document

. Note that a DID controller might be the

DID
subject

.

DID delegate

An entity to whom a

DID controller

has granted permission to use a

verification method

associated with a

DID

via a

DID
document

. For example, a parent who controls a child's

DID document

might permit the child to use their personal device in order to

authenticate

. In this case, the child is the

DID delegate

. The
child's personal device would contain the private cryptographic material
enabling the child to

authenticate

using the

DID

. However, the child
might not be permitted to add other personal devices without the parent's
permission.

DID document

A set of data describing the

DID subject

, including mechanisms, such as
cryptographic public keys, that the

DID subject

or a

DID delegate

can use to

authenticate

itself and prove its association with the

DID

. A DID document might have one or more different

representations

as defined in

6.

Representations

or in the

W3C

DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

DID fragment

The portion of a

DID URL

that follows the first hash sign character
(

#

). DID fragment syntax is identical to URI fragment syntax.

DID method

A definition of how a specific

DID method scheme

is implemented. A DID method is
defined by a DID method specification, which specifies the precise operations by
which

DIDs

and

DID documents

are created, resolved, updated,
and deactivated. See

8.

Methods

.

DID path

The portion of a

DID URL

that begins with and includes the first forward
slash (

/

) character and ends with either a question mark
(

?

) character, a fragment hash sign (

#

) character,
or the end of the

DID URL

. DID path syntax is identical to URI path syntax.
See

Path

.

DID query

The portion of a

DID URL

that follows and includes the first question
mark character (

?

). DID query syntax is identical to URI query
syntax. See

Query

.

DID resolution

The process that takes as its input a

DID

and a set of resolution
options and returns a

DID document

in a conforming

representation

plus additional metadata. This process relies on the "Read" operation of the
applicable

DID method

. The inputs and outputs of this process are
defined in

7.1

DID Resolution

.

DID resolver

A

DID resolver

is a software and/or hardware component that performs the

DID resolution

function by taking a

DID

as input and producing a
conforming

DID document

as output.

DID scheme

The formal syntax of a

decentralized identifier

. The generic DID scheme
begins with the prefix

did:

as defined in

3.1

DID Syntax

. Each

DID method

specification defines a specific
DID method scheme that works with that specific

DID method

. In a specific DID
method scheme, the DID method name follows the first colon and terminates with
the second colon, e.g.,

did:example:

DID subject

The entity identified by a

DID

and described by a

DID document

.
Anything can be a DID subject: person, group, organization, physical thing,
digital thing, logical thing, etc.

DID URL

A

DID

plus any additional syntactic component that conforms to the
definition in

3.2

DID URL Syntax

. This includes an optional

DID
path

(with its leading

/

character), optional

DID query

(with its leading

?

character), and optional

DID fragment

(with its leading

#

character).

DID URL dereferencing

The process that takes as its input a

DID URL

and a set of input
metadata, and returns a

resource

. This resource might be a

DID
document

plus additional metadata, a secondary resource
contained within the

DID document

, or a resource entirely
external to the

DID document

. The process uses

DID resolution

to
fetch a

DID document

indicated by the

DID

contained within the

DID URL

. The dereferencing process can then perform additional processing
on the

DID document

to return the dereferenced resource indicated by the

DID URL

. The inputs and outputs of this process are defined in

7.2

DID URL Dereferencing

.

DID URL dereferencer

A software and/or hardware system that performs the

DID URL dereferencing

function for a given

DID URL

or

DID document

.

distributed ledger

(DLT)

A non-centralized system for recording events. These systems establish
sufficient confidence for participants to rely upon the data recorded by others
to make operational decisions. They typically use distributed databases where
different nodes use a consensus protocol to confirm the ordering of
cryptographically signed transactions. The linking of digitally signed
transactions over time often makes the history of the ledger effectively
immutable.

public key description

A data object contained inside a

DID document

that contains all the
metadata necessary to use a public key or a verification key.

resource

As defined by [

RFC3986

]: "...the term 'resource' is used in a general sense
for whatever might be identified by a URI." Similarly, any resource might serve
as a

DID subject

identified by a

DID

.

representation

As defined for HTTP by [

RFC7231

]: "information that is intended to reflect a
past, current, or desired state of a given resource, in a format that can be
readily communicated via the protocol, and that consists of a set of
representation metadata and a potentially unbounded stream of representation
data." A

DID document

is a representation of information describing a

DID subject

. See

6.

Representations

.

representation-specific entries

Entries in a

DID document

whose meaning is particular to a specific

representation

. Defined in

4.

Data Model

and

6.

Representations

. For example,

@context

in
the

JSON-LD representation

is a

representation-specific entry

.

services

Means of communicating or interacting with the

DID subject

or
associated entities via one or more

service endpoints

.
Examples include discovery services, agent services, social networking
services, file storage services, and verifiable credential repository services.

service endpoint

A network address, such as an HTTP URL, at which

services

operate on
behalf of a

DID subject

.

Uniform Resource Identifier

(URI)

The standard identifier format for all resources on the World Wide Web as
defined by [

RFC3986

]. A

DID

is a type of URI scheme.

verifiable credential

A standard data model and representation format for cryptographically-verifiable
digital credentials as defined by the

W3C

Verifiable Credentials specification
[

VC-DATA-MODEL

].

verifiable data registry

A system that facilitates the creation, verification, updating, and/or
deactivation of

decentralized identifiers

and

DID documents

. A
verifiable data registry might also be used for other
cryptographically-verifiable data structures such as

verifiable
credentials

. For more information, see the

W3C

Verifiable Credentials
specification [

VC-DATA-MODEL

].

verifiable timestamp

A verifiable timestamp enables a third-party to verify that a data object
existed at a specific moment in time and that it has not been modified or
corrupted since that moment in time. If the data integrity could reasonably have
been modified or corrupted since that moment in time, the timestamp is not
verifiable.

verification method

A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independently
verify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as a
verification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it
verifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.

"Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. For
example, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman key
exchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees the
integrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verification
method, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words
"verification" or "proof."

verification relationship

An expression of the relationship between the

DID subject

and a

verification method

. An example of a verification relationship is

5.3.1

Authentication

.

Universally Unique Identifier

(UUID)

A type of globally unique identifier defined by [

RFC4122

]. UUIDs are similar
to DIDs in that they do not require a centralized registration authority. UUIDs
differ from DIDs in that they are not resolvable or
cryptographically-verifiable.

In addition to the terminology above, this specification also uses terminology
from the [

INFRA

] specification to formally define the

data model

. When [

INFRA

] terminology is used, such as

string

,

set

, and

map

, it is linked directly to that specification.

3.

Identifier

This section describes the formal syntax for

DIDs

and

DID URLs

.
The term "generic" is used to differentiate the syntax defined here from syntax
defined by

specific

DID methods

in their respective
specifications. The creation processes, and their timing, for

DIDs

and

DID URLs

are described in

8.2

Method Operations

and

B.2

Creation of a DID

.

3.1

DID Syntax

The generic

DID scheme

is a

URI

scheme conformant with
[

RFC3986

]. The ABNF definition can be found below, which uses the syntax in
[

RFC5234

] and the corresponding definitions for

ALPHA

and

DIGIT

. All other rule names not defined in the ABNF below are
defined in [

RFC3986

]. All

DIDs

MUST

conform to the
DID Syntax ABNF Rules.

The DID Syntax ABNF Rules

did                = "did:" method-name ":" method-specific-id
method-name        = 1*method-char
method-char        = %x61-7A / DIGIT
method-specific-id = *( *idchar ":" ) 1*idchar
idchar             = ALPHA / DIGIT / "." / "-" / "_" / pct-encoded
pct-encoded        = "%" HEXDIG HEXDIG

For requirements on

DID methods

relating to the

DID

syntax, see
Section

8.1

Method Syntax

.

3.2

DID URL Syntax

A

DID URL

is a network location identifier for a specific

resource

. It can be used to retrieve things like representations
of

DID subjects

,

verification methods

,

services

,
specific parts of a

DID document

, or other resources.

The following is the ABNF definition using the syntax in [

RFC5234

]. It builds
on the

did

scheme defined in

3.1

DID Syntax

. The

path-abempty

,

query

, and

fragment

components are
defined in [

RFC3986

]. All

DID URLs

MUST

conform to the
DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules.

DID methods

can further restrict these
rules, as described in

8.1

Method Syntax

.

The DID URL Syntax ABNF Rules

did-url = did path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

Note

: Semicolon character is reserved for future use

Although the semicolon (

;

) character can be used according to the
rules of the

DID URL

syntax, future versions of this specification may
use it as a sub-delimiter for parameters as described in [

MATRIX-URIS

]. To
avoid future conflicts, developers ought to refrain from using it.

Path

A

DID path

is identical to a generic

URI

path and conforms to the

path-abempty

ABNF rule in

RFC 3986, section 3.3

. As with

URIs

, path semantics can be specified by

DID Methods

, which in
turn might enable

DID controllers

to further specialize those semantics.

Example

2

did:example:123456/path

Query

A

DID query

is identical to a generic

URI

query and conforms to
the

query

ABNF rule in

RFC 3986, section 3.4

. This syntax
feature is elaborated upon in

3.2.1

DID Parameters

.

Example

3

did:example:123456?versionId=1

Fragment

DID fragment

syntax and semantics are identical to a generic

URI

fragment and conforms to the

fragment

ABNF rule in

RFC 3986, section 3.5

.

A

DID fragment

is used as a method-independent reference into a

DID
document

or external

resource

. Some examples of DID fragment
identifiers are shown below.

Example

4

: A unique verification method in a DID Document

did:example:123#public-key-0

Example

5

: A unique service in a DID Document

did:example:123#agent

Example

6

: A resource external to a DID Document

did:example:123?service=agent&relativeRef=/credentials#degree

Note

: Fragment semantics across representations

In order to maximize interoperability, implementers are urged to ensure that

DID fragments

are interpreted in the same way across

representations

(see

6.

Representations

). For example, while
JSON Pointer [

RFC6901

] can be used in a

DID fragment

, it will not be
interpreted in the same way across non-JSON

representations

.

Additional semantics for fragment identifiers, which are compatible with and
layered upon the semantics in this section, are described for JSON-LD
representations in

E.2

application/did+ld+json

. For information
about how to dereference a

DID fragment

, see

7.2

DID URL Dereferencing

.

3.2.1

DID Parameters

The

DID URL

syntax supports a simple format for parameters based on the

query

component described in

Query

. Adding a DID
parameter to a

DID URL

means that the parameter becomes part of the
identifier for a

resource

.

Example

7

: A DID URL with a 'versionTime' DID parameter

did:example:123?versionTime=2021-05-10T17:00:00Z

Example

8

: A DID URL with a 'service' and a 'relativeRef' DID parameter

did:example:123?service=files&relativeRef=/resume.pdf

Some DID parameters are completely independent of of any specific

DID
method

and function the same way for all

DIDs

. Other DID parameters
are not supported by all

DID methods

. Where optional parameters are
supported, they are expected to operate uniformly across the

DID methods

that do support them. The following table provides common DID parameters that
function the same way across all

DID methods

. Support for all

DID Parameters

is

OPTIONAL

.

Note

It is generally expected that DID URL dereferencer implementations will
reference [

DID-RESOLUTION

] for additional implementation details. The scope
of this specification only defines the contract of the most common
query parameters.

Parameter Name

Description

service

Identifies a service from the

DID document

by service ID.
If present, the associated value

MUST

be an

ASCII string

.

relativeRef

A relative

URI

reference according to

RFC3986 Section 4.2

that identifies a

resource

at a

service endpoint

, which is selected from a

DID
document

by using the

service

parameter.
If present, the associated value

MUST

be an

ASCII string

and

MUST

use percent-encoding for
certain characters as specified in

RFC3986
Section 2.1

.

versionId

Identifies a specific version of a

DID document

to be resolved (the
version ID could be sequential, or a

UUID

, or method-specific).
If present, the associated value

MUST

be an

ASCII string

.

versionTime

Identifies a certain version timestamp of a

DID document

to be resolved.
That is, the

DID document

that was valid for a

DID

at a certain
time. If present, the associated value

MUST

be an

ASCII string

which is a valid XML
datetime value, as defined in section 3.3.7 of

W3C

XML Schema Definition Language
(XSD) 1.1 Part 2: Datatypes

[

XMLSCHEMA11-2

]. This datetime value

MUST

be
normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision.
For example:

2020-12-20T19:17:47Z

.

hl

A resource hash of the

DID document

to add integrity protection, as
specified in [

HASHLINK

]. This parameter is non-normative.
If present, the associated value

MUST

be an

ASCII string

.

Implementers as well as

DID method

specification authors might use
additional DID parameters that are not listed here. For maximum
interoperability, it is

RECOMMENDED

that DID parameters use the DID
Specification Registries mechanism [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

], to avoid collision
with other uses of the same DID parameter with different semantics.

DID parameters might be used if there is a clear use case where the parameter
needs to be part of a

URL

that references a

resource

with more
precision than using the

DID

alone. It is expected that DID parameters
are

not

used if the same functionality can be expressed by passing
input metadata to a

DID resolver

. Additional considerations for
processing these parameters are discussed in [

DID-RESOLUTION

].

Note

: DID parameters and DID resolution

The

DID resolution

and the

DID URL dereferencing

functions can
be influenced by passing input metadata to a

DID resolver

that are
not part of the

DID URL

(see

7.1.1

DID Resolution Options

). This is comparable to
HTTP, where certain parameters could either be included in an HTTP URL, or
alternatively passed as HTTP headers during the dereferencing process. The
important distinction is that DID parameters that are part of the

DID
URL

should be used to specify

what

resource

is being
identified

, whereas input metadata that is not part of the

DID URL

should be use to control

how that

resource

is resolved or
dereferenced

.

3.2.2

Relative DID URLs

A relative

DID URL

is any URL value in a

DID document

that does
not start with

did:<method-name>:<method-specific-id>

. More
specifically, it is any URL value that does not start with the ABNF defined in

3.1

DID Syntax

. The URL is expected to reference
a

resource

in the same

DID document

. Relative

DID URLs

MAY

contain relative path components, query parameters, and fragment identifiers.

When resolving a relative

DID URL

reference, the algorithm specified in

RFC3986 Section 5: Reference Resolution

MUST

be used. The

base URI

value is the

DID

that is
associated with the

DID subject

, see

5.1.1

DID Subject

. The

scheme

is

did

. The

authority

is a
combination of

<method-name>:<method-specific-id>

, and the

path

,

query

, and

fragment

values are those defined in

Path

,

Query

, and

Fragment

, respectively.

Relative

DID URLs

are often used to reference

verification methods

and

services

in a

DID Document

without having to use absolute
URLs.

DID methods

where storage size is a consideration might use
relative URLs to reduce the storage size of

DID documents

.

Example

9

: An example of a relative DID URL

{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
  ]
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "verificationMethod": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",

// external (property value)

"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  }, ...],
  "authentication": [

// a relative DID URL used to reference a verification method above

"

#key-1

"
  ]
}

In the example above, the relative

DID URL

value will be transformed to
an absolute

DID URL

value of

did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1

.

4.

Data Model

This specification defines a data model that can be used to express

DID
documents

and DID document data structures, which can then be serialized
into multiple concrete

representations

. This section provides a
high-level description of the data model, descriptions of the ways different
types of properties are expressed in the data model, and instructions for
extending the data model.

A

DID document

consists of a

map

of

entries

, where each entry consists of a
key/value pair. The

DID document

data model contains at least two
different classes of entries. The first class of entries is called properties,
and is specified in section

5.

Core Properties

. The second class
is made up of

representation-specific entries

, and is specified in
section

6.

Representations

.

Figure

3

The entries in a DID document.
See also:

narrative description

.

The diagram is titled, "Entries in the DID Document map". A dotted grey line
runs horizontally through the center of the diagram. The space above the line
is labeled "Properties", and the space below it, "Representation-specific
entries". Six labeled rectangles appear in the diagram, three lying above the
dotted grey line and three below it. A large green rectangle, labeled "DID
Specification Registries", encloses the four leftmost rectangles (upper left,
upper center, lower left, and lower center). The two leftmost rectangles
(upper left and lower left) are outlined in blue and labeled in blue, as
follows. The upper left rectangle is labeled "Core Properties", and contains
text "id, alsoKnownAs, controller, authentication, verificationMethod, service,
serviceEndpoint, ...". The lower left rectangle is labeled "Core
Representation-specific Entries", and contains text "@context". The four
rightmost rectangles (upper center, upper right, lower center, and lower right)
are outlined in grey and labeled in black, as follows. The upper center
rectangle is labeled, "Property Extensions", and contains text
"ethereumAddress". The lower center rectangle is labeled,
"Representation-specific Entry Extensions", and contains no other text. The
upper right rectangle is labeled, "Unregistered Property Extensions", and
contains text "foo". The lower right rectangle is labeled "Unregistered
Representation-specific Entry Extensions", and contains text "%YAML, xmlns".

All entry keys in the

DID document

data model are

strings

. All entry values are expressed using one
of the abstract data types in the table below, and each

representation

specifies the concrete serialization format of each data type.

Data Type

Considerations

map

A finite ordered sequence of key/value pairs, with no key appearing twice as
specified in [

INFRA

]. A map is sometimes referred to as an

ordered map

in [

INFRA

].

list

A finite ordered sequence of items as specified in [

INFRA

].

set

A finite ordered sequence of items that does not contain the same item twice
as specified in [

INFRA

]. A set is sometimes referred to as an

ordered set

in [

INFRA

].

datetime

A date and time value that is capable of losslessly expressing all values
expressible by a

dateTime

as specified in
[

XMLSCHEMA11-2

].

string

A sequence of code units often used to represent human readable language
as specified in [

INFRA

].

integer

A real number without a fractional component as specified in
[

XMLSCHEMA11-2

]. To maximize
interoperability, implementers are urged to heed the advice regarding
integers in

RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers

.

double

A value that is often used to approximate arbitrary real numbers as specified
in [

XMLSCHEMA11-2

]. To maximize
interoperability, implementers are urged to heed the advice regarding
doubles in

RFC8259, Section 6: Numbers

.

boolean

A value that is either true or false as defined in [

INFRA

].

null

A value that is used to indicate the lack of a value as defined in [

INFRA

].

As a result of the

data model

being defined using
terminology from [

INFRA

], property values which can contain more than one
item, such as

lists

,

maps

and

sets

, are explicitly ordered. All list-like
value structures in [

INFRA

] are ordered, whether or not that order is
significant. For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise stated,

map

and

set

ordering is not important and
implementations are not expected to produce or consume deterministically ordered
values.

4.1

Extensibility

The data model supports two types of extensibility.

For maximum interoperability, it is

RECOMMENDED

that extensions use the

W3C

DID Specification Registries mechanism [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]. The use of
this mechanism for new properties or other extensions is the only specified
mechanism that ensures that two different

representations

will be able to
work together.

Representations

MAY

define other extensibility mechanisms, including ones
that do not require the use of the DID Specification Registries. Such extension
mechanisms

SHOULD

support lossless conversion into any other conformant

representation

. Extension mechanisms for a

representation

SHOULD

define a mapping of all properties and

representation

syntax into the

data model

and its type system.

Note

: Unregistered extensions are less reliable

It is always possible for two specific implementations to agree out-of-band to
use a mutually understood extension or

representation

that is not
recorded in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

];
interoperability between such implementations and the larger ecosystem will be
less reliable.

5.

Core Properties

A

DID

is associated with a

DID document

.

DID documents

are expressed using the

data model

and can be serialized into a

representation

.
The following sections define the properties in a

DID document

,
including whether these properties are required or optional. These properties
describe relationships between the

DID subject

and the value of the
property.

The following tables contain informative references for the core properties
defined by this specification, with expected values, and whether or not they are
required. The property names in the tables are linked to the normative
definitions and more detailed descriptions of each property.

Note

: Property names used in maps of different types

and/or

.

5.1

Identifiers

This section describes the mechanisms by which

DID documents

include identifiers for

DID subjects

and

DID controllers

.

5.1.1

DID Subject

The

DID

for a particular

DID subject

is expressed using the

id

property in the

DID document

.

id

The value of

id

MUST

be a

string

that conforms to the rules in

3.1

DID Syntax

and

MUST

exist in the root

map

of the

data
model

for the

DID document

.

Example

10

{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghijk"
}

The

id

property only denotes the

DID

of the

DID subject

when it is present in the

topmost

map

of the

DID document

.

Note

: Intermediate representations

DID method

specifications can create intermediate representations of a

DID document

that do not contain the

id

property,
such as when a

DID resolver

is performing

DID resolution

.
However, the fully resolved

DID document

always contains a valid

id

property.

5.1.2

DID Controller

A

DID controller

is an entity that is authorized to make changes to a

DID document

. The process of authorizing a

DID controller

is
defined by the

DID method

.

controller

The

controller

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the value

MUST

be a

string

or a

set

of

strings

that conform to the rules in

3.1

DID Syntax

. The corresponding

DID document

(s)

SHOULD

contain

verification relationships

that explicitly permit the use of
certain

verification methods

for specific purposes.

When a

controller

property is present in a

DID
document

, its value expresses one or more

DIDs

. Any

verification
methods

contained in the

DID documents

for those

DIDs

SHOULD

be accepted as authoritative, such that proofs that satisfy those

verification methods

are to be considered equivalent to proofs provided
by the

DID subject

.

Example

11

: DID document with a controller property

{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "controller": "did:example:bcehfew7h32f32h7af3",
}

Note

: Authorization vs authentication

Note that authorization provided by the value of

controller

is
separate from authentication as described in

5.3.1

Authentication

.
This is particularly important for key recovery in the case of cryptographic key
loss, where the

DID subject

no longer has access to their keys, or key
compromise, where the

DID controller

's trusted third parties need to
override malicious activity by an attacker. See

9.

Security Considerations

for information related to threat models
and attack vectors.

5.1.3

Also Known As

A

DID subject

can have multiple identifiers for different purposes, or
at different times. The assertion that two or more

DIDs

(or other types
of

URI

) refer to the same

DID subject

can be made using the

alsoKnownAs

property.

alsoKnownAs

The

alsoKnownAs

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the value

MUST

be a

set

where each item in the
set is a

URI

conforming to [

RFC3986

].

This relationship is a statement that the subject of this identifier is
also identified by one or more other identifiers.

Note

: Equivalence and alsoKnownAs

Applications might choose to consider two identifiers related by

alsoKnownAs

to be equivalent

if

the

alsoKnownAs

relationship is reciprocated in the reverse
direction. It is best practice

not

to consider them equivalent in the
absence of this inverse relationship. In other words, the presence of an

alsoKnownAs

assertion does not prove that this assertion
is true. Therefore, it is strongly advised that a requesting party obtain
independent verification of an

alsoKnownAs

assertion.

Given that the

DID subject

might use different identifiers for different
purposes, an expectation of strong equivalence between the two identifiers, or
merging the information of the two corresponding

DID documents

, is not
necessarily appropriate,

even with

a reciprocal relationship.

5.2

Verification Methods

A

DID document

can express

verification methods

, such as
cryptographic public keys, which can be used to

authenticate

or authorize
interactions with the

DID subject

or associated parties. For example, a
cryptographic public key can be used as a

verification method

with
respect to a digital signature; in such usage, it verifies that the signer
could use the associated cryptographic private key.

Verification methods

might take many parameters. An example of this is a set of five cryptographic
keys from which any three are required to contribute to a cryptographic
threshold signature.

verificationMethod

The

verificationMethod

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the value

MUST

be a

set

of

verification
methods

, where each

verification method

is expressed using a

map

. The

verification method

map

MUST

include the

id

,

type

,

controller

, and specific verification material
properties that are determined by the value of

type

and are defined
in

5.2.1

Verification Material

. A

verification method

MAY

include additional properties.

Verification methods

SHOULD

be registered
in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

id

The value of the

id

property for a

verification
method

MUST

be a

string

that conforms to the
rules in Section

3.2

DID URL Syntax

.

type

The value of the

type

property

MUST

be a

string

that references exactly one

verification
method

type. In order to maximize global interoperability, the

verification method

type

SHOULD

be registered in the DID Specification
Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

controller

The value of the

controller

property

MUST

be a

string

that conforms to the rules in

3.1

DID Syntax

.

Note

: Verification method controller(s) and DID controller(s)

The semantics of the

controller

property are the same when the
subject of the relationship is the

DID document

as when the subject of
the relationship is a

verification method

, such as a cryptographic public
key. Since a key can't control itself, and the key controller cannot be inferred
from the

DID document

, it is necessary to explicitly express the identity
of the controller of the key. The difference is that the value of

controller

for a

verification method

is

not

necessarily a

DID controller

.

DID controllers

are expressed
using the

controller

property at the highest level of the

DID document

(the topmost

map

in the

data model

); see

5.1.2

DID Controller

.

5.2.1

Verification Material

Verification material is any information that is used by a process that applies
a

verification method

. The

type

of a

verification
method

is expected to be used to determine its compatibility with such
processes. Examples of verification material properties are

publicKeyJwk

or

publicKeyMultibase

. A

cryptographic suite

specification is responsible for specifying the

verification method

type

and its associated verification
material. For example, see

JSON
Web Signature 2020

and

Ed25519 Signature 2020

.
For all registered

verification method

types and associated verification
material available for

DIDs

, please see the DID Specification Registries
[

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

To increase the likelihood of interoperable implementations, this specification
limits the number of formats for expressing verification material in a

DID
document

. The fewer formats that implementers have to
implement, the more likely it will be that they will support all of them. This
approach attempts to strike a delicate balance between ease of implementation
and supporting formats that have historically had broad deployment.
Two supported verification material properties are listed below:

publicKeyJwk

The

publicKeyJwk

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the value

MUST

be a

map

representing a JSON Web Key that
conforms to [

RFC7517

]. The

map

MUST NOT

contain "d", or any other members of the private information class as described
in

Registration
Template

. It is

RECOMMENDED

that verification methods that use JWKs
[

RFC7517

] to represent their public keys use the value of

kid

as
their

fragment identifier

. It is

RECOMMENDED

that JWK

kid

values are set to the public key fingerprint [

RFC7638

]. See
the first key in

Example

13

for
an example of a public key with a compound key identifier.

publicKeyMultibase

The

publicKeyMultibase

property is

OPTIONAL

. This feature is
non-normative. If present, the value

MUST

be a

string

representation of a [

MULTIBASE

] encoded
public key.

Note that the [

MULTIBASE

] specification is not yet a standard and is
subject to change. There might be some use cases for this data format
where

public

KeyMultibase

is defined, to allow for
expression of public keys, but

private

KeyMultibase

is not defined, to protect against accidental leakage of secret keys.

A

verification method

MUST NOT

contain multiple verification material
properties for the same material. For example, expressing key material in a

verification method

using both

publicKeyJwk

and

publicKeyMultibase

at the same time is prohibited.

An example of a

DID document

containing

verification methods

using
both properties above is shown below.

  }],

...

}

5.2.2

Referring to Verification Methods

Verification methods

can be embedded in or referenced from properties
associated with various

verification relationships

as described in

5.3

Verification Relationships

. Referencing

verification methods

allows them to be used by more than one

verification relationship

.

If the value of a

verification method

property is a

map

, the

verification method

has been
embedded and its properties can be accessed directly. However, if the value is a
URL

string

, the

verification method

has
been included by reference and its properties will need to be retrieved from
elsewhere in the

DID document

or from another

DID document

. This
is done by dereferencing the URL and searching the resulting

resource

for a

verification method

map

with an

id

property whose value matches the URL.

Example

14

: Embedding and referencing verification methods

{

...

"authentication": [

// this key is referenced and might be used by

// more than one verification relationship

"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",

// this key is embedded and may *only* be used for authentication

{
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",

// external (property value)

"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }
  ],

...

}

5.3

Verification Relationships

A

verification relationship

expresses the relationship between the

DID
subject

and a

verification method

.

Different

verification relationships

enable the associated

verification methods

to be used for different purposes. It is up to a

verifier

to ascertain the validity of a verification attempt by
checking that the

verification method

used is contained in the
appropriate

verification relationship

property of the

DID Document

.

The

verification relationship

between the

DID subject

and the

verification method

is explicit in the

DID document

.

Verification methods

that are not associated with a particular

verification relationship

cannot be used for that

verification
relationship

. For example, a

verification method

in the value of
the

authentication

property cannot be used to engage in
key agreement protocols with the

DID subject

—the value of the

keyAgreement

property needs to be used for that.

The

DID document

does not express revoked keys using a

verification
relationship

. If a referenced verification method is not in the latest

DID Document

used to dereference it, then that verification method is
considered invalid or revoked. Each

DID method

specification is expected
to detail how revocation is performed and tracked.

The following sections define several useful

verification relationships

.
A

DID document

MAY

include any of these, or other properties, to
express a specific

verification relationship

. In order to maximize global
interoperability, any such properties used

SHOULD

be registered in the DID
Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

5.3.1

Authentication

The

authentication

verification relationship

is used to
specify how the

DID subject

is expected to be

authenticated

, for
purposes such as logging into a website or engaging in any sort of
challenge-response protocol.

authentication

The

authentication

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the associated
value

MUST

be a

set

of one or more

verification methods

. Each

verification method

MAY

be embedded or
referenced.

Example

15

: Authentication property
                      containing three verification methods

{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",

...

"authentication": [

// this method can be used to authenticate as did:...fghi

"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",

// this method is *only* approved for authentication, it may not

// be used for any other proof purpose, so its full description is

// embedded here rather than using only a reference

{
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",
      "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }
  ],

...

}

If authentication is established, it is up to the

DID method

or other
application to decide what to do with that information. A particular

DID
method

could decide that authenticating as a

DID controller

is
sufficient to, for example, update or delete the

DID document

. Another

DID method

could require different keys, or a different

verification
method

entirely, to be presented in order to update or delete the

DID
document

than that used to

authenticate

. In other words, what is done

after

the authentication check is out of scope for the

data model

;

DID methods

and applications are
expected to define this themselves.

This is useful to any

authentication verifier

that needs to check to
see if an entity that is attempting to

authenticate

is, in fact,
presenting a valid proof of authentication. When a

verifier

receives
some data (in some protocol-specific format) that contains a proof that was made
for the purpose of "authentication", and that says that an entity is identified
by the

DID

, then that

verifier

checks to ensure that the proof
can be verified using a

verification method

(e.g., public key) listed
under

authentication

in the

DID Document

.

Note that the

verification method

indicated by the

authentication

property of a

DID document

can only be
used to

authenticate

the

DID subject

. To

authenticate

a
different

DID controller

, the entity associated with the value of

controller

, as defined in

5.1.2

DID Controller

, needs to

authenticate

with its

own

DID document

and associated

authentication

verification relationship

.

5.3.2

Assertion

The

assertionMethod

verification relationship

is used to
specify how the

DID subject

is expected to express claims, such as for
the purposes of issuing a Verifiable Credential [

VC-DATA-MODEL

].

assertionMethod

The

assertionMethod

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the
associated value

MUST

be a

set

of
one or more

verification methods

. Each

verification method

MAY

be
embedded or referenced.

This property is useful, for example, during the processing of a

verifiable
credential

by a verifier. During verification, a verifier checks to see if a

verifiable credential

contains a proof created by the

DID subject

by checking that the

verification method

used to assert the proof is
associated with the

assertionMethod

property in the
corresponding

DID document

.

Example

16

: Assertion method property
                    containing two verification methods

{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",

...

"assertionMethod": [

// this method can be used to assert statements as did:...fghi

"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",

// this method is *only* approved for assertion of statements, it is not

// used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is

// embedded here rather than using a reference

{
      "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
      "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",

// external (property value)

"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }
  ],

...

}

5.3.3

Key Agreement

The

keyAgreement

verification relationship

is used to
specify how an entity can generate encryption material in order to transmit
confidential information intended for the

DID subject

, such as for
the purposes of establishing a secure communication channel with the recipient.

keyAgreement

The

keyAgreement

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the associated
value

MUST

be a

set

of one or more

verification methods

. Each

verification method

MAY

be embedded or
referenced.

An example of when this property is useful is when encrypting a message intended
for the

DID subject

. In this case, the counterparty uses the
cryptographic public key information in the

verification method

to wrap a
decryption key for the recipient.

Example

17

: Key agreement property
                      containing two verification methods

{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",

...

"keyAgreement": [

// this method can be used to perform key agreement as did:...fghi

"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",

// this method is *only* approved for key agreement usage, it will not

// be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is

// embedded here rather than using only a reference

{
      "id": "did:example:123#zC9ByQ8aJs8vrNXyDhPHHNNMSHPcaSgNpjjsBYpMMjsTdS",
      "type": "X25519KeyAgreementKey2019",

// external (property value)

"controller": "did:example:123",
      "publicKeyMultibase": "z9hFgmPVfmBZwRvFEyniQDBkz9LmV7gDEqytWyGZLmDXE"
    }
  ],

...

}

5.3.4

Capability Invocation

The

capabilityInvocation

verification relationship

is used
to specify a

verification method

that might be used by the

DID
subject

to invoke a cryptographic capability, such as the authorization to
update the

DID Document

.

capabilityInvocation

The

capabilityInvocation

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the
associated value

MUST

be a

set

of
one or more

verification methods

. Each

verification method

MAY

be
embedded or referenced.

An example of when this property is useful is when a

DID subject

needs to
access a protected HTTP API that requires authorization in order to use it. In
order to authorize when using the HTTP API, the

DID subject

uses a capability that is associated with a particular URL that is
exposed via the HTTP API. The invocation of the capability could be
expressed in a number of ways, e.g., as a digitally signed
message that is placed into the HTTP Headers.

The server providing the HTTP API is the

verifier

of the capability and
it would need to verify that the

verification method

referred to by the
invoked capability exists in the

capabilityInvocation

property of the

DID document

. The verifier would also check to make sure
that the action being performed is valid and the capability is appropriate for
the resource being accessed. If the verification is successful, the server has
cryptographically determined that the invoker is authorized to access the
protected resource.

Example

18

: Capability invocation property
                      containing two verification methods

{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",

...

"capabilityInvocation": [

// this method can be used to invoke capabilities as did:...fghi

"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",

// this method is *only* approved for capability invocation usage, it will not

// be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is

// embedded here rather than using only a reference

{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",

// external (property value)

"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }
  ],

...

}

5.3.5

Capability Delegation

The

capabilityDelegation

verification relationship

is used
to specify a mechanism that might be used by the

DID subject

to delegate
a cryptographic capability to another party, such as delegating the authority
to access a specific HTTP API to a subordinate.

capabilityDelegation

The

capabilityDelegation

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the
associated value

MUST

be a

set

of
one or more

verification methods

. Each

verification method

MAY

be
embedded or referenced.

An example of when this property is useful is when a

DID controller

chooses to delegate their capability to access a protected HTTP API to a party
other than themselves. In order to delegate the capability, the

DID
subject

would use a

verification method

associated with the

capabilityDelegation

verification relationship

to
cryptographically sign the capability over to another

DID subject

. The
delegate would then use the capability in a manner that is similar to the
example described in

5.3.4

Capability Invocation

.

Example

19

: Capability Delegation property
                      containing two verification methods

{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"
  ],
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",

...

"capabilityDelegation": [

// this method can be used to perform capability delegation as did:...fghi

"did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",

// this method is *only* approved for granting capabilities; it will not

// be used for any other verification relationship, so its full description is

// embedded here rather than using only a reference

{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-2",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020",

// external (property value)

"controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
    }
  ],

...

}

5.4

Services

Services

are used in

DID documents

to express ways of
communicating with the

DID subject

or associated entities. A

service

can be any type of service the

DID subject

wants to
advertise, including

decentralized identity management

services for
further discovery, authentication, authorization, or interaction.

Due to privacy concerns, revealing public information through

services

,
such as social media accounts, personal websites, and email addresses, is
discouraged. Further exploration of privacy concerns can be found in

10.1

Keep Personal Data Private

and

10.6

Service Privacy

. The
information associated with

services

is often service specific. For
example, the information associated with an encrypted messaging service can
express how to initiate the encrypted link before messaging begins.

Services

are expressed using the

service

property,
which is described below:

service

The

service

property is

OPTIONAL

. If present, the associated value

MUST

be a

set

of

services

,
where each service is described by a

map

.
Each

service

map

MUST

contain

id

,

type

, and

serviceEndpoint

properties. Each service extension

MAY

include additional properties and

MAY

further restrict the properties associated
with the extension.

id

The value of the

id

property

MUST

be a

URI

conforming to
[

RFC3986

]. A

conforming producer

MUST NOT

produce
multiple

service

entries with the same

id

.
A

conforming consumer

MUST

produce an error if it detects
multiple

service

entries with the same

id

.

type

The value of the

type

property

MUST

be a

string

or a

set

of

strings

. In order to maximize interoperability,
the

service

type and its associated properties

SHOULD

be
registered in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

serviceEndpoint

The value of the

serviceEndpoint

property

MUST

be a

string

, a

map

, or
a

set

composed of one or more

strings

and/or

maps

. All

string

values

MUST

be valid

URIs

conforming to [

RFC3986

] and normalized
according to the

Normalization and Comparison
rules in RFC3986

and to any normalization rules in its applicable

URI

scheme specification.

6.

Representations

A concrete serialization of a

DID document

in this specification is
called a

representation

. A

representation

is created by
serializing the

data model

through a process called

production

. A

representation

is transformed into the

data model

through a process called

consumption

. The

production

and

consumption

processes enable the conversion of information from one

representation

to
another. This specification defines

representations

for JSON and JSON-LD,
and developers can use any other

representation

, such as XML or
YAML, that is capable of expressing the

data model

.
The following sections define the general rules for

production

and

consumption

, as well as the JSON and JSON-LD

representations

.

6.1

Production and Consumption

In addition to the

representations

defined in this specification,
implementers can use other

representations

, providing each such

representation

is properly specified (including rules for
interoperable handling of properties not listed in the DID Specification
Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]). See

4.1

Extensibility

for more information.

The requirements for all

representations

are as follows:

A

representation

MUST

define deterministic production and consumption
rules for all data types specified in

4.

Data Model

.

A

representation

MUST

be uniquely associated with an IANA-registered
Media Type.

A

representation

MUST

define fragment processing rules for its Media
Type that are conformant with the fragment processing rules defined in

Fragment

.

A

representation

SHOULD

use the lexical representation of

data model

data types. For example, JSON and JSON-LD use
the XML Schema

dateTime

lexical serialization to represent

datetimes

. A

representation

MAY

choose to serialize the

data model

data types using a different lexical
serializations as long as the

consumption

process back into the

data model

is lossless. For example, some CBOR-based

representations

express

datetime

values using integers to
represent the number of seconds since the Unix epoch.

A

representation

MAY

define

representation-specific entries

that
are stored in a

representation-specific entries

map

for use during the

production

and

consumption

process. These
entries are used when consuming or producing to aid in ensuring lossless
conversion.

In order to maximize interoperability,

representation

specification
authors

SHOULD

register their

representation

in the DID Specification
Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

The requirements for all

conforming producers

are as follows:

A

conforming producer

MUST

take a

DID document

data model

and a

representation-specific entries

map

as input into the

production

process.
The

conforming producer

MAY

accept additional options as input
into the

production

process.

A

conforming producer

MUST

serialize all entries in the

DID
document

data model

, and the

representation-specific entries

map

,
that do not
have explicit processing rules for the

representation

being produced
using only the

representation

's data type processing rules and
return the serialization after the

production

process completes.

A

conforming producer

MUST

return the Media Type

string

associated with the

representation

after the

production

process completes.

A conforming producer

MUST NOT

produce non-conforming

DIDs

or

DID
documents

.

The requirements for all

conforming consumers

are as follows:

A

conforming consumer

MUST

take a

representation

and
Media Type

string

as input into
the

consumption

process. A

conforming consumer

MAY

accept
additional options as input into the

consumption

process.

A

conforming consumer

MUST

determine the

representation

of a

DID document

using the Media Type input

string

.

A

conforming consumer

MUST

detect any

representation-specific
entry

across all known

representations

and place the entry into a

representation-specific entries

map

which is returned after the

consumption

process completes. A list of
all known

representation-specific entries

is available in the
DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

A

conforming consumer

MUST

add all

non-representation-specific
entries

that do not have explicit processing rules for the

representation

being
consumed to the

DID document

data model

using
only the

representation

's data type processing rules and return the

DID document

data model after the

consumption

process completes.

A conforming consumer

MUST

produce errors when consuming non-conforming

DIDs

or

DID documents

.

From the grey-outlined rectangle, three pairs of arrows extend to three
different black-outlined rectangles, one on the upper right of the diagram, one
in the lower right, and one in the lower left. Each pair of arrows consists of
one blue arrow pointing from the grey-outlined rectangle to the respective
black-outlined rectangle, labeled "produce", and one red arrow pointing in the
reverse direction, labeled "consume". The black-outlined rectangle in the upper
right is labeled "application/did+cbor", and contains hexadecimal data. The
rectangle in the lower right is labeled "application/did+json", and contains
the following JSON data:

Note

: Conversion between representations

An implementation is expected to convert between

representations

by using
the

consumption

rules on the source representation resulting in the

data model

and then using the

production

rules
to serialize

data model

to the target representation,
or any other mechanism that results in the same target representation.

6.2

JSON

This section defines the

production

and

consumption

rules
for the JSON

representation

.

6.2.1

Production

The

DID document

, DID document data structures, and

representation-specific entries

map

MUST

be serialized to the JSON

representation

according to the following

production

rules:

Data Type

JSON Representation Type

map

A

JSON Object

, where each entry is
serialized as a member of the JSON Object with the entry key as a

JSON String

member name and the entry value
according to its type, as defined in this table.

list

A

JSON Array

, where each element of the
list is serialized, in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as
defined in this table.

set

A

JSON Array

, where each element of the set
is added, in order, as a value of the array according to its type, as defined in
this table.

datetime

A

JSON String

serialized as an

XML Datetime

normalized to
UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For example:

2020-12-20T19:17:47Z

.

string

A

JSON String

.

integer

A

JSON Number

without a decimal or
fractional component.

double

A

JSON Number

with a decimal and
fractional component.

boolean

A

JSON Boolean

.

null

A

JSON null literal

.

All implementers creating

conforming producers

that produce JSON

representations

are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned
with the

JSON
serialization rules

in the [

INFRA

] specification and the

precision advisements regarding Numbers

in the
JSON [

RFC8259

] specification.

All entries of a

DID document

MUST

be included in the root

JSON Object

. Entries

MAY

contain additional
data substructures subject to the value representation rules in the list above.
When serializing a

DID document

, a

conforming producer

MUST

specify a media type of

application/did+json

to downstream
applications such as described in

7.1.2

DID Resolution Metadata

.

Example

21

: Example DID document in JSON representation

{
  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "authentication": [{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#keys-1",
    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKeyBase58": "H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"
  }]
}

6.2.2

Consumption

The

DID document

and DID document data structures JSON

representation

MUST

be deserialized into the

data
model

according to the following

consumption

rules:

JSON Representation Type

Data Type

JSON Object

A

map

, where each member of the JSON
Object is added as an entry to the map. Each entry key is set as the
JSON Object member name. Each entry value is set by converting the JSON Object
member value according to the JSON representation type as defined in this table.
Since order is not specified by JSON Objects, no insertion order is guaranteed.

JSON Array

where the

data model

entry value is a

list

or unknown

A

list

, where each value of the JSON Array is
added to the list in order, converted based on the JSON representation type of
the array value, as defined in this table.

JSON Array

where the

data model

entry value is a

set

A

set

, where each value of
the JSON Array is added to the set in order, converted based on the JSON
representation type of the array value, as defined in this table.

JSON String

where

data model

entry value is a

datetime

A

datetime

.

JSON String

, where the

data model

entry value type is

string

or
unknown

A

string

.

JSON Number

without a decimal or
fractional component

An

integer

.

JSON Number

with a decimal and fractional
component, or when entry value is a

double

regardless of inclusion of
fractional component

A

double

.

JSON Boolean

A

boolean

.

JSON null literal

A

null

value.

All implementers creating

conforming consumers

that produce JSON

representations

are advised to ensure that their algorithms are aligned
with the

JSON
conversion rules

in the [

INFRA

] specification and the

precision advisements regarding Numbers

in the
JSON [

RFC8259

] specification.

If media type information is available to a

conforming consumer

and the
media type value is

application/did+json

, then the data structure
being consumed is a

DID document

, and the root element

MUST

be a

JSON Object

where all members of the object
are entries of the

DID document

. A

conforming consumer

for a JSON

representation

that is consuming a

DID document

with a root
element that is not a

JSON Object

MUST

report an error.

6.3

JSON-LD

JSON-LD [

JSON-LD11

] is a JSON-based format used to serialize

Linked Data

. This
section defines the

production

and

consumption

rules for the
JSON-LD

representation

.

The JSON-LD

representation

defines the following

representation-specific entries

:

@context

The

JSON-LD Context

is either a

string

or a

list

containing any combination of

strings

and/or

ordered
maps

.

6.3.1

Production

The

DID document

, DID document data structures, and

representation-specific entries

map

MUST

be serialized to the JSON-LD

representation

according to the JSON

representation

production

rules as defined in

6.2

JSON

.

In addition to using the JSON

representation

production

rules,
JSON-LD production

MUST

include the

representation-specific

@context

entry. The serialized value of

@context

MUST

be the

JSON
String

https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1

, or a

JSON Array

where the first item is the

JSON String

https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1

and the subsequent items are
serialized according to the JSON

representation

production

rules.

Example

22

: A valid serialization of a simple @context entry

{

"@context"

:

"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"

,
  ...
}

Example

23

: A valid serialization of a layered @context entry

{

"@context"

: [

"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"

,

"https://did-method-extension.example/v1"

],
  ...
}

All implementers creating

conforming producers

that produce JSON-LD

representations

are advised to ensure that their algorithms
produce valid JSON-LD [

JSON-LD11

] documents. Invalid JSON-LD documents will
cause JSON-LD processors to halt and report errors.

In order to achieve interoperability across different

representations

,
all JSON-LD Contexts and their terms

SHOULD

be registered in the DID
Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

A

conforming producer

that generates a JSON-LD

representation

SHOULD NOT

produce a

DID document

that contains terms not defined via the

@context

as

conforming consumers

are expected to remove
unknown terms. When serializing a JSON-LD

representation

of a

DID
document

, a

conforming producer

MUST

specify a media type of

application/did+ld+json

to downstream applications such as
described in

7.1.2

DID Resolution Metadata

.

6.3.2

Consumption

The

DID document

and any DID document data structures expressed by a
JSON-LD

representation

MUST

be deserialized into the

data model

according to the JSON

representation

consumption

rules as defined in

6.2

JSON

.

All implementers creating

conforming consumers

that consume JSON-LD

representations

are advised to ensure that their algorithms only accept
valid JSON-LD [

JSON-LD11

] documents. Invalid JSON-LD documents will cause
JSON-LD processors to halt and report errors.

Conforming consumers

that process a JSON-LD

representation

SHOULD

drop all terms from a

DID document

that are not defined via the

@context

.

7.

Resolution

This section defines the inputs and outputs of

DID resolution

and

DID
URL dereferencing

. Their exact implementation is out of scope for this
specification, but some considerations for implementers are discussed in
[

DID-RESOLUTION

].

All conformant

DID resolvers

MUST

implement the

DID resolution

functions for at least one

DID method

and

MUST

be able to return a

DID document

in at least one conformant

representation

.

7.1

DID Resolution

The

DID resolution

functions resolve a

DID

into a

DID
document

by using the "Read" operation of the applicable

DID method

as described in

8.2

Method Operations

. The details of how this
process is accomplished are outside the scope of this specification, but all
conforming

DID resolvers

implement the functions below, which have the
following abstract forms:

resolve(did, resolutionOptions) →
   « didResolutionMetadata, didDocument, didDocumentMetadata »

resolveRepresentation(did, resolutionOptions) →
   « didResolutionMetadata, didDocumentStream, didDocumentMetadata »

The

resolve

function returns the

DID document

in its
abstract form (a

map

). The

resolveRepresentation

function returns a byte stream of the

DID
Document

formatted in the corresponding representation.

The upper middle part of the diagram contains a rectangle with dashed grey outline, containing two
                blue-outlined rectangles, one above the other.
                The upper, larger rectangle is labeled, in blue, "Core Properties", and contains the following

From the grey-outlined rectangle, three pairs of arrows extend to three
                different black-outlined rectangles, aligned in a horizontal row side-by-side, in the bottom half
                of the diagram. Each pair of arrows consists of
                one blue arrow pointing from the grey-outlined rectangle to the respective
                black-outlined rectangle, labeled "produce", and one red arrow pointing in the
                reverse direction, labeled "consume". The first black-outlined rectangle in the row
                is labeled "application/did+ld+json", and contains
                the following JSON-LD data:

{

"@context"

: [

"https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"

],

"id"

:

"did:example:123"

,

"verificationMethod"

: [{

}],

"authentication"

: [

}

The second rectangle in the row is labeled "application/did+json" and contains the following
                JSON data:

{

"id"

:

"did:example:123"

,

"verificationMethod"

:

"H3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVA"

}],

"authentication"

: [

"did:example:123#keys-1"

]
}

The third rectangle in the row is labeled "application/did+cbor", and contains hexadecimal data.

In the left part of the diagram, in the middle, there is a box, with black outline and light gray
                background. This box is labeled "VERIFIABLE DATA REGISTRY" and contains a symbol representing a graph
                with nodes and arcs. From this box, one arrow, labeled "resolve()", extends upwards and points to the
                top half of the diagram where the grey-outlined rectangle is located. Another arrow, labeled
                "resolveRepresentation()", extends downwards and points to the bottom half of the diagram, where the
                row of three black-outlined rectangles is located.

The input variables
of the

resolve

and

resolveRepresentation

functions are
as follows:

did

This is the

DID

to resolve. This input is

REQUIRED

and the value

MUST

be a conformant

DID

as defined in

3.1

DID Syntax

.

resolutionOptions

A

metadata structure

containing properties
defined in

7.1.1

DID Resolution Options

. This input is

REQUIRED

, but the structure

MAY

be empty.

These functions each return multiple values, and no limitations
are placed on how these values are returned together.
The return values of

resolve

are

didResolutionMetadata

,

didDocument

, and

didDocumentMetadata

. The return values of

resolveRepresentation

are

didResolutionMetadata

,

didDocumentStream

, and

didDocumentMetadata

. These values are described below:

didResolutionMetadata

A

metadata structure

consisting of values
relating to the results of the

DID resolution

process which typically
changes between invocations of the

resolve

and

resolveRepresentation

functions, as it represents data about the
resolution process itself. This structure is

REQUIRED

, and in the case of an
error in the resolution process, this

MUST NOT

be empty. This metadata is
defined by

7.1.2

DID Resolution Metadata

. If

resolveRepresentation

was called, this structure

MUST

contain a

contentType

property containing the Media Type of the
representation found in the

didDocumentStream

. If the resolution is
not successful, this structure

MUST

contain an

error

property
describing the error.

didDocument

If the resolution is successful, and if the

resolve

function was
called, this

MUST

be a

DID document

abstract data model (a

map

) as described in

4.

Data Model

that
is capable of being transformed into a

conforming DID Document

(representation), using the production rules specified by the representation.
The value of

id

in the resolved

DID document

MUST

match the

DID

that was resolved. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this
value

MUST

be empty.

didDocumentStream

If the resolution is successful, and if the

resolveRepresentation

function was called, this

MUST

be a byte stream of the resolved

DID
document

in one of the conformant

representations

. The byte stream might then be
parsed by the caller of the

resolveRepresentation

function into a

data model

, which can in turn be validated and
processed. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this value

MUST

be an empty
stream.

didDocumentMetadata

If the resolution is successful, this

MUST

be a

metadata structure

. This structure contains
metadata about the

DID document

contained in the

didDocument

property. This metadata typically does not change between invocations of the

resolve

and

resolveRepresentation

functions unless the

DID document

changes, as it represents metadata about the

DID
document

. If the resolution is unsuccessful, this output

MUST

be an empty

metadata structure

. Properties defined by this
specification are in

7.1.3

DID Document Metadata

.

Conforming

DID resolver

implementations do not alter the signature of
these functions in any way.

DID resolver

implementations might map the

resolve

and

resolveRepresentation

functions to a
method-specific internal function to perform the actual

DID resolution

process.

DID resolver

implementations might implement and expose
additional functions with different signatures in addition to the

resolve

and

resolveRepresentation

functions specified
here.

7.1.1

DID Resolution Options

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
registered in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]. This
specification defines the following common properties.

accept

The Media Type of the caller's preferred

representation

of the

DID
document

. The Media Type

MUST

be expressed as an

ASCII string

. The

DID resolver

implementation

SHOULD

use this
value to determine the

representation

contained in the returned

didDocumentStream

if such a

representation

is supported and
available. This property is

OPTIONAL

for the

resolveRepresentation

function and

MUST NOT

be used with the

resolve

function.

7.1.2

DID Resolution Metadata

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
registered in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]. This
specification defines the following DID resolution metadata properties:

contentType

The Media Type of the returned

didDocumentStream

. This property is

REQUIRED

if resolution is successful and if the

resolveRepresentation

function was called.
This property

MUST NOT

be present if the

resolve

function was called. The value of this
property

MUST

be an

ASCII string

that is the Media
Type of the conformant

representations

. The
caller of the

resolveRepresentation

function

MUST

use this value
when determining how to parse and process the

didDocumentStream

returned by this function into the

data model

.

error

The error code from the resolution process. This property is

REQUIRED

when there
is an error in the resolution process. The value of this property

MUST

be a
single keyword

ASCII string

. The possible property
values of this field

SHOULD

be registered in the DID Specification Registries
[

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]. This specification defines the following
common error values:

invalidDid

The

DID

supplied to the

DID resolution

function does not conform
to valid syntax. (See

3.1

DID Syntax

.)

notFound

The

DID resolver

was unable to find the

DID document

resulting from this resolution request.

representationNotSupported

This error code is returned if the

representation

requested via the

accept

input metadata property is not supported by the

DID
method

and/or

DID resolver

implementation.

7.1.3

DID Document Metadata

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values

SHOULD

be registered in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].
This specification defines the following common properties.

created

DID document

metadata

SHOULD

include a

created

property to
indicate the timestamp of the

Create operation

.
The value of the property

MUST

be a

string

formatted as an

XML Datetime

normalized to UTC 00:00:00 and without sub-second decimal precision. For
example:

2020-12-20T19:17:47Z

.

updated

DID document

metadata

SHOULD

include an

updated

property to
indicate the timestamp of the last

Update
operation

for the document version which was resolved. The value of the
property

MUST

follow the same formatting rules as the

created

property. The

updated

property is omitted if an Update operation
has never been performed on the

DID document

. If an

updated

property exists, it can be the same value as the

created

property
when the difference between the two timestamps is less than one second.

deactivated

If a DID has been

deactivated

,

DID document

metadata

MUST

include this property with the boolean value

true

. If a DID has not been deactivated, this property is

OPTIONAL

,
but if included,

MUST

have the boolean value

false

.

nextUpdate

DID document

metadata

MAY

include a

nextUpdate

property if
the resolved document version is not the latest version of the document. It
indicates the timestamp of the next

Update
operation

. The value of the property

MUST

follow the same formatting rules
as the

created

property.

versionId

DID document

metadata

SHOULD

include a

versionId

property to
indicate the version of the last

Update
operation

for the document version which was resolved. The value of the
property

MUST

be an

ASCII string

.

nextVersionId

DID document

metadata

MAY

include a

nextVersionId

property
if the resolved document version is not the latest version of the document. It
indicates the version of the next

Update
operation

. The value of the property

MUST

be an

ASCII string

.

equivalentId

A

DID method

can define different forms of a

DID

that are
logically equivalent. An example is when a

DID

takes one form prior to
registration in a

verifiable data registry

and another form after such
registration. In this case, the

DID method

specification might need to
express one or more

DIDs

that are logically equivalent to the resolved

DID

as a property of the

DID document

. This is the purpose of the

equivalentId

property.

DID document

metadata

MAY

include an

equivalentId

property.
If present, the value

MUST

be a

set

where each item is a

string

that conforms to the rules in Section

3.1

DID Syntax

. The relationship is a statement that each

equivalentId

value is logically equivalent to the

id

property value and thus refers to the same

DID subject

.
Each

equivalentId

DID value

MUST

be produced by, and a form
of, the same

DID method

as the

id

property value. (e.g.,

did:example:abc

==

did:example:ABC

)

A conforming

DID method

specification

MUST

guarantee that each

equivalentId

value is logically equivalent to the

id

property value.

A requesting party is expected to retain the values from the

id

and

equivalentId

properties to ensure any subsequent
interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
logically equivalent (e.g., retain all variants in a database so an interaction
with any one maps to the same underlying account).

Note

: Stronger equivalence

equivalentId

is a much stronger form of equivalence than

alsoKnownAs

because the equivalence

MUST

be guaranteed by
the governing

DID method

.

equivalentId

represents a
full graph merge because the same

DID document

describes both the

equivalentId

DID

and the

id

property

DID

.

If a requesting party does not retain the values from the

id

and

equivalentId

properties and ensure any subsequent
interactions with any of the values they contain are correctly handled as
logically equivalent, there might be negative or unexpected issues that
arise. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the
directives related to this metadata property.

canonicalId

The

canonicalId

property is identical to the

equivalentId

property except: a) it is associated with a
single value rather than a set, and b) the

DID

is defined to be
the canonical ID for the

DID subject

within the scope of the containing

DID document

.

DID document

metadata

MAY

include a

canonicalId

property.
If present, the value

MUST

be a

string

that conforms to the rules in Section

3.1

DID Syntax

. The relationship is a statement that the

canonicalId

value is logically equivalent to the

id

property value and that the

canonicalId

value is defined by the

DID method

to be the canonical ID for the

DID
subject

in the scope of the containing

DID document

. A

canonicalId

value

MUST

be produced by, and a form of, the
same

DID method

as the

id

property value. (e.g.,

did:example:abc

==

did:example:ABC

).

A conforming

DID method

specification

MUST

guarantee that the

canonicalId

value is logically equivalent to the

id

property value.

A requesting party is expected to use the

canonicalId

value
as its primary ID value for the

DID subject

and treat all other
equivalent values as secondary aliases (e.g., update corresponding primary
references in their systems to reflect the new canonical ID directive).

Note

: Canonical equivalence

canonicalId

is the same statement of equivalence as

equivalentId

except it is constrained to a single value that
is defined to be canonical for the

DID subject

in the scope of the

DID
document

. Like

equivalentId

,

canonicalId

represents a full graph merge because the same

DID document

describes both the

canonicalId

DID and
the

id

property

DID

.

If a resolving party does not use the

canonicalId

value as
its primary ID value for the DID subject and treat all other equivalent values
as secondary aliases, there might be negative or unexpected issues that arise
related to user experience. Implementers are strongly advised to observe the
directives related to this metadata property.

7.2

DID URL Dereferencing

The

DID URL dereferencing

function dereferences a

DID URL

into a

resource

with contents depending on the

DID URL

's components,
including the

DID method

, method-specific identifier, path, query, and
fragment. This process depends on

DID resolution

of the

DID

contained in the

DID URL

.

DID URL dereferencing

might involve
multiple steps (e.g., when the DID URL being dereferenced includes a fragment),
and the function is defined to return the final resource after all steps are
completed. The details of how this process is accomplished are outside the scope
of this specification. The following figure depicts the relationship described
above.

All conforming

DID resolvers

implement
the following function which has the following abstract form:

dereference(didUrl, dereferenceOptions) →
   « dereferencingMetadata, contentStream, contentMetadata »

The input variables of the

dereference

function are as follows:

didUrl

A conformant

DID URL

as a single

string

.
This is the

DID URL

to dereference. To dereference a

DID fragment

,
the complete

DID URL

including the

DID fragment

MUST

be used. This
input is

REQUIRED

.

Note

: DID URL dereferencer patterns

While it is valid for any

didUrl

to be passed to a DID URL
dereferencer, implementers are expected to refer to [

DID-RESOLUTION

] to
further understand common patterns for how a

DID URL

is expected
to be dereferenced.

dereferencingOptions

A

metadata structure

consisting of input
options to the

dereference

function in addition to the

didUrl

itself. Properties defined by this specification are in

7.2.1

DID URL Dereferencing Options

. This input is

REQUIRED

, but the
structure

MAY

be empty.

This function returns multiple values, and no limitations
are placed on how these values are returned together.
The return values of the

dereference

include

dereferencingMetadata

,

contentStream

,
and

contentMetadata

:

dereferencingMetadata

A

metadata structure

consisting of values
relating to the results of the

DID URL dereferencing

process. This
structure is

REQUIRED

, and in the case of an error in the dereferencing process,
this

MUST NOT

be empty. Properties defined by this specification are in

7.2.2

DID URL Dereferencing Metadata

. If the dereferencing is not
successful, this structure

MUST

contain an

error

property
describing the error.

contentStream

If the

dereferencing

function was called and successful, this

MUST

contain a

resource

corresponding to the

DID URL

. The

contentStream

MAY

be a

resource

such as a

DID
document

that is serializable in one of the conformant

representations

, a

Verification
Method

, a

service

, or any other resource format that
can be identified via a Media Type and obtained through the resolution process.
If the dereferencing is unsuccessful, this value

MUST

be empty.

contentMetadata

If the dereferencing is successful, this

MUST

be a

metadata structure

, but the structure

MAY

be empty. This structure contains
metadata about the

contentStream

. If the

contentStream

is a

DID document

, this

MUST

be a

didDocumentMetadata

structure as
described in

DID Resolution

. If the dereferencing is unsuccessful, this
output

MUST

be an empty

metadata structure

.

Conforming

DID URL dereferencing

implementations do not alter the
signature of these functions in any way.

DID URL dereferencing

implementations might map the

dereference

function to a
method-specific internal function to perform the actual

DID URL
dereferencing

process.

DID URL dereferencing

implementations might
implement and expose additional functions with different signatures in addition
to the

dereference

function specified here.

7.2.1

DID URL Dereferencing Options

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values

SHOULD

be registered in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].
This specification defines the following common properties for
dereferencing options:

accept

The Media Type that the caller prefers for

contentStream

. The Media
Type

MUST

be expressed as an

ASCII string

. The

DID URL dereferencing

implementation

SHOULD

use this value to determine
the

contentType

of the

representation

contained in the
returned value if such a

representation

is supported and available.

7.2.2

DID URL Dereferencing Metadata

The possible properties within this structure and their possible values are
registered in the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]. This
specification defines the following common properties.

contentType

The Media Type of the returned

contentStream

SHOULD

be expressed
using this property if dereferencing is successful. The Media
Type value

MUST

be expressed as an

ASCII string

.

error

The error code from the dereferencing process. This property is

REQUIRED

when
there is an error in the dereferencing process. The value of this property

MUST

be a single keyword expressed as an

ASCII
string

. The possible property values of this field

SHOULD

be registered in
the DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]. This specification
defines the following common error values:

invalidDidUrl

The

DID URL

supplied to the

DID URL dereferencing

function does
not conform to valid syntax. (See

3.2

DID URL Syntax

.)

notFound

The

DID URL dereferencer

was unable to find the

contentStream

resulting from this dereferencing request.

7.3

Metadata Structure

Input and output metadata is often involved during the

DID Resolution

,

DID URL dereferencing

, and other DID-related processes. The structure
used to communicate this metadata

MUST

be a

map

of properties. Each property name

MUST

be a

string

. Each property value

MUST

be a

string

,

map

,

list

,

set

,

boolean

, or

null

. The values within any complex data
structures such as maps and lists

MUST

be one of these data types as well.
All metadata property definitions registered in the DID Specification
Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

]

MUST

define the value type, including any
additional formats or restrictions to that value (for example, a string
formatted as a date or as a decimal integer). It is

RECOMMENDED

that property
definitions use strings for values. The entire metadata structure

MUST

be
serializable according to the

JSON
serialization rules

in the [

INFRA

] specification. Implementations

MAY

serialize the metadata structure to other data formats.

All implementations of functions that use metadata structures as either input or
output are able to fully represent all data types described here in a
deterministic fashion. As inputs and outputs using metadata structures are
defined in terms of data types and not their serialization, the method for

representation

is internal to the implementation of the function and is
out of scope of this specification.

The following example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that
might be used as

DID
resolution input metadata

.

Example

24

: JSON-encoded DID resolution input metadata example

{

"accept"

:

"application/did+ld+json"

}

This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:

Example

25

: DID resolution input metadata example

«[

"accept"

→

"application/did+ld+json"

]»

The next example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that might be
used as

DID resolution
metadata

if a

DID

was not found.

Example

26

: JSON-encoded DID resolution metadata example

{

"error"

:

"notFound"

}

This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:

Example

27

: DID resolution metadata example

«[

"error"

→

"notFound"

]»

The next example demonstrates a JSON-encoded metadata structure that might be
used as

DID document metadata

to describe timestamps associated with the

DID document

.

Example

28

: JSON-encoded DID document metadata example

{

"created"

:

"2019-03-23T06:35:22Z"

,

"updated"

:

"2023-08-10T13:40:06Z"

}

This example corresponds to a metadata structure of the following format:

Example

29

: DID document metadata example

«[

"created"

→

"2019-03-23T06:35:22Z"

,

"updated"

→

"2023-08-10T13:40:06Z"

8.

Methods

A

DID method

defines how implementers can realize the features
described by this specification.

DID methods

are often associated with a
particular

verifiable data registry

. New

DID methods

are defined
in their own specifications to enable interoperability between different
implementations of the same

DID method

.

Conceptually, the relationship between this specification and a

DID
method

specification is similar to the relationship between the IETF generic

URI

specification [

RFC3986

] and a specific

URI

scheme
[

IANA-URI-SCHEMES

], such as the

http

scheme [

RFC7230

]. In
addition to defining a specific

DID scheme

, a

DID method

specification also defines the mechanisms for creating, resolving, updating, and
deactivating

DIDs

and

DID documents

using a specific type of

verifiable data registry

. It also documents all implementation
considerations related to

DIDs

as well as Security and Privacy
Considerations.

This section specifies the requirements for authoring

DID method

specifications.

8.1

Method Syntax

The requirements for all

DID method

specifications when defining the
method-specific DID Syntax are as follows:

A

DID method

specification

MUST

define exactly one method-specific

DID
scheme

that is identified by exactly one method name as specified by the

method-name

rule in

3.1

DID Syntax

.

The

DID method

specification

MUST

specify how to generate the

method-specific-id

component of a

DID

.

The

DID method

specification

MUST

define sensitivity and normalization of
the value of the

method-specific-id

.

The

method-specific-id

value

MUST

be unique within a

DID
method

. The

method-specific-id

value itself might be globally
unique.

Any

DID

generated by a

DID method

MUST

be globally unique.

To reduce the chances of

method-name

conflicts, a

DID method

specification

SHOULD

be registered in the DID Specification Registries
[

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

].

A

DID method

MAY

define multiple

method-specific-id

formats.

The

method-specific-id

format

MAY

include colons. The use of
colons

MUST

comply syntactically with the

method-specific-id

ABNF
rule.

A

DID method

specification

MAY

specify ABNF rules for

DID paths

that are more restrictive than the generic rules in

Path

.

A

DID method

specification

MAY

specify ABNF rules for

DID queries

that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

A

DID method

specification

MAY

specify ABNF rules for

DID
fragments

that are more restrictive than the generic rules in this section.

Note

: Colons in method-specific-id

The meaning of colons in the

method-specific-id

is entirely
method-specific. Colons might be used by

DID methods

for establishing
hierarchically partitioned namespaces, for identifying specific instances or
parts of the

verifiable data registry

, or for other purposes.
Implementers are advised to avoid assuming any meanings or
behaviors associated with a colon that are generically applicable to all

DID methods

.

8.2

Method Operations

The requirements for all

DID method

specifications when defining the
method operations are as follows:

A

DID method

specification

MUST

define how authorization is performed to
execute all operations, including any necessary cryptographic processes.

A

DID method

specification

MUST

specify how a

DID controller

creates a

DID

and its associated

DID document

.

A

DID method

specification

MUST

specify how a

DID resolver

uses a

DID

to resolve a

DID document

, including how the

DID
resolver

can verify the authenticity of the response.

A

DID method

specification

MUST

specify what constitutes an update to a

DID document

and how a

DID controller

can update a

DID
document

or

state that updates are not possible.

The

DID method

specification

MUST

specify how a

DID controller

can
deactivate a

DID

or

state that deactivation is not possible.

The authority of a party that is performing authorization to carry out the
operations is specific to a

DID method

. For example, a

DID method

might —

make use of the

controller

property.

use the

verification methods

listed under

authentication

.

use other constructs in the

DID Document

such as the

verification
method

specified via the

capabilityInvocation

verification relationship

.

not use the

DID document

for this decision at all, and depend on an
out-of-band mechanism, instead.

8.3

Security Requirements

The requirements for all

DID method

specifications when authoring the

Security Considerations

section are as follows:

A

DID method

specifications

MUST

follow all guidelines and normative
language provided in

RFC3552: Writing Security
Considerations Sections

for the

DID

operations defined in the

DID
method

specification.

The Security Considerations section

MUST

document the following forms of attack
for the

DID

operations defined in the

DID method

specification:
eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, denial of
service,

amplification

, and man-in-the-middle. Other known
forms of attack

SHOULD

also be documented.

The Security Considerations section

MUST

discuss residual risks, such as the
risks from compromise in a related protocol, incorrect implementation, or cipher
after threat mitigation was deployed.

The Security Considerations section

MUST

provide integrity protection and update
authentication for all operations required by Section

8.2

Method Operations

.

If authentication is involved, particularly user-host authentication, the
security characteristics of the authentication method

MUST

be clearly
documented.

The Security Considerations section

MUST

discuss the policy mechanism by which

DIDs

are proven to be uniquely assigned.

Method-specific endpoint authentication

MUST

be discussed. Where

DID
methods

make use of

DLTs

with varying network topology, sometimes
offered as

light node

or

thin client

implementations to reduce required computing resources, the security assumptions
of the topology available to implementations of the

DID method

MUST

be
discussed.

If a protocol incorporates cryptographic protection mechanisms, the

DID
method

specification

MUST

clearly indicate which portions of the data are
protected and by what protections, and it

SHOULD

give an indication of the
sorts of attacks to which the cryptographic protection is susceptible. Some
examples are integrity only, confidentiality, and endpoint authentication.

Data which is to be held secret (keying material, random seeds, and so on)

SHOULD

be clearly labeled.

DID method

specifications

SHOULD

explain and specify the implementation
of signatures on

DID documents

, if applicable.

Where

DID methods

use peer-to-peer computing resources, such as with all
known

DLTs

, the expected burdens of those resources

SHOULD

be discussed
in relation to denial of service.

DID methods

that introduce new authentication

service

types, as described in

5.4

Services

,

SHOULD

consider the
security requirements of the supported authentication protocol.

8.4

Privacy Requirements

The requirements for all

DID method

specifications when authoring the

Privacy Considerations

section are:

The

DID method

specification's Privacy Considerations section

MUST

discuss any subsection of Section 5 of [

RFC6973

] that could apply in a
method-specific manner. The subsections to consider are: surveillance, stored
data compromise, unsolicited traffic, misattribution, correlation,
identification, secondary use, disclosure, and exclusion.

9.

Security Considerations

This section is non-normative.

This section contains a variety of security considerations that people using
Decentralized Identifiers are advised to consider before deploying this
technology in a production setting.

DIDs

are designed to operate under
the threat model used by many IETF standards and documented
in [

RFC3552

]. This section elaborates upon a number of the considerations
in [

RFC3552

], as well as other considerations that are unique to

DID

architecture.

9.1

Choosing DID Resolvers

The DID Specification Registries [

DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES

] contains an
informative list of

DID method

names and their corresponding

DID
method

specifications. Implementers need to bear in mind that there is no
central authority to mandate which

DID method

specification is to be used
with any specific

DID method

name. If there is doubt on whether or not a
specific

DID resolver

implements a

DID method

correctly, the DID
Specification Registries can be used to look up the registered specification
and make an informed decision regarding which

DID resolver

implementation to use.

9.2

Proving Control and Binding

Binding an entity in the digital world or the physical world to a

DID

, to
a

DID document

, or to cryptographic material requires, the use of
security protocols contemplated by this specification. The following sections
describe some possible scenarios and how an entity therein might prove control
over a

DID

or a

DID document

for the purposes of authentication or
authorization.

Proving Control of a DID and/or DID Document

Proving control over a

DID

and/or a

DID Document

is useful when
updating either in a

verifiable data registry

or authenticating with
remote systems. Cryptographic digital signatures and

verifiable
timestamps

enable certain security protocols related to

DID documents

to be cryptographically verifiable. For these purposes, this specification
defines useful

verification relationships

in

5.3.1

Authentication

and

5.3.4

Capability Invocation

. The
secret cryptographic material associated with the

verification methods

can be used to generate a cryptographic digital signature as a part of an
authentication or authorization security protocol.

Note

: Signed DID documents

Some

DID methods

allow digital signatures and other proofs to be
included in the

DID document

or a

7.3

Metadata Structure

.
However, such proofs by themselves do not necessarily prove control over a

DID

, or guarantee that the

DID document

is the correct one for
the

DID

. In order to obtain
the correct

DID document

and verify control over a

DID

, it is
necessary to perform the

DID resolution

process as defined by the

DID method

.

Binding to Physical Identity

A

DID

and

DID document

do not inherently carry any

personal data

and
it is strongly advised that non-public entities do not publish personal data in

DID documents

.

It can be useful to express a binding of a

DID

to a person's or
organization's physical identity in a way that is provably asserted by a
trusted authority, such as a government. This specification provides
the

5.3.2

Assertion

verification relationship

for these
purposes. This feature can enable interactions that are private and can be
considered legally enforceable under one or more jurisdictions; establishing
such bindings has to be carefully balanced against privacy considerations (see

10.

Privacy Considerations

).

The process of binding a

DID

to something in the physical world, such as
a person or an organization — for example, by using

verifiable
credentials

with the same subject as that

DID

— is contemplated
by this specification and further defined in the Verifiable Credentials Data
Model [

VC-DATA-MODEL

].

9.3

Authentication Service Endpoints

If a

DID document

publishes a

service

intended for
authentication or authorization of the

DID subject

(see Section

5.4

Services

), it is the responsibility of the

service
endpoint

provider, subject, or requesting party to comply with the
requirements of the authentication protocols supported at that

service
endpoint

.

9.4

Non-Repudiation

Non-repudiation of

DIDs

and

DID document

updates is supported if:

The

verifiable data registry

supports

verifiable timestamps

. See

7.1.3

DID Document Metadata

for further information on useful timestamps that can be used during the

DID resolution

process.

The subject is monitoring for unauthorized updates as elaborated upon in

9.5

Notification of DID Document Changes

.

The subject has had adequate opportunity to revert malicious updates according
to the authorization mechanism for the

DID method

.

9.5

Notification of DID Document Changes

One mitigation against unauthorized changes to a

DID document

is
monitoring and actively notifying the

DID subject

when there are changes.
This is analogous to helping prevent account takeover on conventional
username/password accounts by sending password reset notifications to the email
addresses on file.

In the case of a

DID

, there is no intermediary registrar or account
provider to generate such notifications. However, if the

verifiable data
registry

on which the

DID

is registered directly supports change
notifications, a subscription service can be offered to

DID controllers

.
Notifications could be sent directly to the relevant

service endpoints

listed in an existing

DID

.

If a

DID controller

chooses to rely on a third-party monitoring service
(other than the

verifiable data registry

itself), this introduces another
vector of attack.

9.6

Key and Signature Expiration

In a

decentralized identifier

architecture, there might not be
centralized authorities to enforce cryptographic material or cryptographic
digital signature expiration policies. Therefore, it is with supporting software
such as

DID resolvers

and verification libraries that requesting parties
validate that cryptographic material were not expired at the time they were
used. Requesting parties might employ their own expiration policies in addition
to inputs into their verification processes. For example, some requesting
parties might accept authentications from five minutes in the past, while others
with access to high precision time sources might require authentications to be
time stamped within the last 500 milliseconds.

There are some requesting parties that have legitimate needs to extend the use
of already-expired cryptographic material, such as verifying legacy
cryptographic digital signatures. In these scenarios, a requesting party might
instruct their verification software to ignore cryptographic key material
expiration or determine if the cryptographic key material was expired at the
time it was used.

9.7

Verification Method Rotation

Rotation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic material
associated with an existing

verification method

to be deactivated or
destroyed once a new

verification method

has been added to the

DID
document

. Going forward, any new proofs that a

controller

would have
generated using the old secret cryptographic material can now instead be
generated using the new  cryptographic material and can be verified using the
new

verification method

.

Rotation is a useful mechanism for protecting against verification method
compromise, since frequent rotation of a verification method by the controller
reduces the value of a single compromised verification method to an attacker.
Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for verification
methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications, such as
those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.

The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of

verification method

rotation:

Verification method

rotation is a proactive security measure.

It is generally considered a best practice to perform

verification method

rotation on a regular basis.

Higher security environments tend to employ more frequent verification method
rotation.

Verification method

rotation manifests only as changes to the current or
latest version of a

DID document

.

When a

verification method

has been active for a long time, or used for
many operations, a controller might wish to perform a rotation.

Frequent rotation of a

verification method

might be frustrating for
parties that are forced to continuously renew or refresh associated credentials.

Proofs or signatures that rely on

verification methods

that are not
present in the latest version of a

DID document

are not impacted by
rotation. In these cases, verification software might require additional
information, such as when a particular

verification method

was
expected to be valid as well as access to a

verifiable data registry

containing a historical record, to determine the validity of the proof or
signature. This option might not be available in all

DID methods

.

The section on

DID method operations

specifies
the

DID

operations to be supported by a

DID method

specification,
including

update

which is expected to be used
to perform a

verification method

rotation.

A

controller

performs a rotation when they add a new

verification
method

that is meant to replace an existing

verification method

after
some time.

Not all

DID methods

support

verification method

rotation.

9.8

Verification Method Revocation

Revocation is a management process that enables the secret cryptographic
material associated with an existing

verification method

to be
deactivated such that it ceases to be a valid form of creating new
proofs of digital signatures.

Revocation is a useful mechanism for reacting to a verification method
compromise. Performing revocation immediately after rotation is useful for
verification methods that a controller designates for short-lived verifications,
such as those involved in encrypting messages and authentication.

Compromise of the secrets associated with a

verification method

allows
the attacker to use them according to the

verification relationship

expressed by

controller

in the

DID document

, for example, for
authentication. The attacker's use of the secrets might be indistinguishable
from the legitimate

controller's

use starting from
the time the

verification method

was registered, to the time it was
revoked.

The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of

verification method

revocation:

Verification method

revocation is a reactive security measure.

It is considered a best practice to support key revocation.

A

controller

is expected to immediately revoke any

verification
method

that is known to be compromised.

Verification method

revocation can only be embodied in changes to
the latest version of a

DID Document

; it cannot retroactively adjust
previous versions.

As described in

5.2.1

Verification Material

, absence of a verification
method is the only form of revocation that applies to all

DID Methods

that support revocation.

If a

verification method

is no longer exclusively accessible to the

controller

or parties trusted to act on behalf of the

controller

,
it is expected to be revoked immediately to reduce the risk of
compromises such as masquerading, theft, and fraud.

Revocation is expected to be understood as a

controller

expressing that
proofs or signatures associated with a revoked

verification method

created after its revocation should be treated as invalid. It could also imply a
concern that existing proofs or signatures might have been created by an
attacker, but this is not necessarily the case. Verifiers, however, might still
choose to accept or reject any such proofs or signatures at their own
discretion.

The section on

DID method operations

specifies
the

DID

operations to be supported by a

DID method

specification,
including

update

and

deactivate

, which might be used to remove
a

verification method

from a

DID document

.

Not all

DID methods

support

verification method

revocation.

Even if a

verification method

is present in a

DID document

,
additional information, such as a public key revocation certificate, or an
external allow or deny list, could be used to determine whether a

verification method

has been revoked.

The day-to-day operation of any software relying on a compromised

verification method

, such as an individual's operating system, antivirus,
or endpoint protection software, could be impacted when the

verification
method

is publicly revoked.

Revocation Semantics

Although verifiers might choose not to accept proofs or signatures from a
revoked verification method, knowing whether a verification was made with a
revoked

verification method

is trickier than it might seem. Some

DID
methods

provide the ability to look back at the state of a

DID

at a
point in time, or at a particular version of the

DID document

. When such
a feature is combined with a reliable way to determine the time or

DID

version that existed when a cryptographically verifiable statement was made,
then revocation does not undo that statement. This can be the basis for using

DIDs

to make binding commitments; for example, to sign a mortgage.

If these conditions are met, revocation is not retroactive; it only nullifies
future use of the method.

However, in order for such semantics to be safe, the second condition — an
ability to know what the state of the

DID document

was at the time the
assertion was made — is expected to apply. Without that guarantee, someone
could discover a revoked key and use it to make cryptographically verifiable
statements with a simulated date in the past.

Some

DID methods

only allow the retrieval of the current state of a

DID

. When this is true, or when the state of a

DID

at the time of
a cryptographically verifiable statement cannot be reliably determined, then the
only safe course is to disallow any consideration of DID state with respect to
time, except the present moment.

DID

ecosystems that take this approach
essentially provide cryptographically verifiable statements as ephemeral tokens
that can be invalidated at any time by the

DID controller

.

Revocation in Trustless Systems

Trustless systems are those where all trust is derived from cryptographically
provable assertions, and more specifically, where no metadata outside of the
cryptographic system is factored into the determination of trust in the system.
To verify a signature of proof for a

verification method

which has been
revoked in a trustless system, a

DID method

needs to support either or
both of the

versionId

or

versionTime

, as well as both the

updated

and

nextUpdate

,

DID document

metadata properties. A verifier can validate a
signature or proof of a revoked key if and only if all of the following are
true:

The proof or signature includes the

versionId

or

versionTime

of the

DID
document

that was used at the point the signature or proof was created.

The verifier can determine the point in time at which the signature or proof was
made; for example, it was anchored on a blockchain.

For the resolved

DID document

metadata, the

updated

timestamp is
before, and the

nextUpdate

timestamp is after, the point in time at which the
signature or proof was made.

In systems that are willing to admit metadata other than those constituting
cryptographic input, similar trust may be achieved -- but always on the
same basis where a careful judgment is made about whether a

DID document

's content at the moment of a signing event
contained the expected content.

9.9

DID Recovery

Recovery is a reactive security measure whereby a

controller

that has
lost the ability to perform DID operations, such as through the loss of a
device, is able to regain the ability to perform DID operations.

The following considerations might be of use when contemplating the use of

DID

recovery:

Performing recovery proactively on an infrequent but regular basis, can help to
ensure that control has not been lost.

It is considered a best practice to never reuse cryptographic material
associated with recovery for any other purposes.

Recovery is commonly performed in conjunction with

verification method rotation

and

verification method revocation

.

Recovery is advised when a

controller

or services trusted to act on their
behalf no longer have the exclusive ability to perform DID operations as
described in

8.2

Method Operations

.

DID method

specifications might choose to enable support for a quorum of
trusted parties to facilitate recovery. Some of the facilities to do so are
suggested in

5.1.2

DID Controller

.

Not all

DID method

specifications will recognize control from

DIDs

registered using other

DID methods

and they might restrict third-party
control to

DIDs

that use the same method.

Access control and recovery in a

DID method

specification can also
include a time lock feature to protect against key compromise by maintaining a
second track of control for recovery.

There are currently no common recovery mechanisms that apply to all

DID methods

.

9.10

The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers

DIDs

achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central
registration authority. This comes at the cost of human memorability.
Algorithms capable of generating globally unambiguous identifiers
produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This
trade-off is often referred to as

Zooko's
Triangle

.

There are use cases where it is desirable to discover a

DID

when
starting from a human-friendly identifier. For example, a natural language
name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a

DID controller

,
such as a mobile telephone number, email address, social media username, or
blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to

DIDs

, and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted, is
outside the scope of this specification.

Solutions to this problem are defined in separate specifications, such as
[

DNS-DID

], that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that
such specifications carefully consider the:

Numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly
identifier for a target entity.

Privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently
correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.

9.11

DIDs as Enhanced URNs

If desired by a

DID controller

, a

DID

or a

DID URL

is
capable of acting as persistent, location-independent resource identifier.
These sorts of identifiers
are classified as Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and are defined in [

RFC8141

].

DIDs

are an enhanced form of URN that provide a
cryptographically secure, location-independent identifier for a digital
resource, while also providing metadata that enables retrieval. Due to the
indirection between the

DID document

and the

DID

itself, the

DID controller

can adjust the actual location of the resource — or
even provide the resource directly — without adjusting the

DID

.

DIDs

of this type can definitively verify that the resource retrieved is,
in fact, the resource identified.

A

DID controller

who intends to use a

DID

for this purpose is
advised to follow the security considerations in [

RFC8141

]. In particular:

The

DID controller

is expected to choose a

DID method

that
supports the controller's requirements for persistence. The Decentralized
Characteristics Rubric [

DID-RUBRIC

] is one tool available to help
implementers decide upon the most suitable

DID method

.

The

DID controller

is expected to publish its operational policies so
requesting parties can determine the degree to which they can rely on the
persistence of a

DID

controlled by that

DID controller

. In the
absence of such policies, requesting parties are not expected to make any
assumption about whether a

DID

is a persistent identifier for the same

DID subject

.

9.12

Immutability

Many cybersecurity abuses hinge on exploiting gaps between reality and the
assumptions of rational, good-faith actors. Immutability of

DID documents

can provide some security benefits. Individual

DID methods

ought to
consider constraints that would eliminate behaviors or semantics they do not
need. The more

locked down

a

DID method

is, while providing the
same set of features, the less it can be manipulated by malicious actors.

As an example, consider that a single edit to a

DID document

can change
anything except the root

id

property of the document. But
is it actually desirable for a

service

to change its

type

after it is defined? Or for a key to change its value? Or
would it be better to require a new

id

when certain
fundamental properties of an object change? Malicious takeovers of a website
often aim for an outcome where the site keeps its host name identifier,
but is subtly changed underneath. If certain properties of the site, such
as the

ASN

associated with its IP address, were required by the specification to be
immutable, anomaly detection would be easier, and attacks would be much
harder and more expensive to carry out.

For

DID methods

tied to a global source of truth, a direct,
just-in-time lookup of the latest version of a

DID document

is always
possible. However, it seems likely that layers of cache might eventually sit
between a

DID resolver

and that source of truth. If they do, believing
the attributes of an object in the

DID document

to have a given state
when they are actually subtly different might invite exploits. This is
particularly true if some lookups are of a full

DID document

, and
others are of partial data where the larger context is assumed.

9.13

Encrypted Data in DID Documents

Encryption algorithms have been known to fail due to advances in cryptography
and computing power. Implementers are advised to assume that any encrypted data
placed in a

DID document

might eventually be made available in clear text
to the same audience to which the encrypted data is available. This is
particularly pertinent if the

DID document

is public.

Encrypting all or parts of a

DID document

is

not

an appropriate
means to protect data in the long term. Similarly, placing encrypted data in
a

DID document

is not an appropriate means to protect personal data.

Given the caveats above, if encrypted data is included in a

DID document

,
implementers are advised to not associate any correlatable information
that could be used to infer a relationship between the encrypted data
and an associated party. Examples of correlatable information include
public keys of a receiving party, identifiers to digital assets known to be
under the control of a receiving party, or human readable descriptions of a
receiving party.

9.14

Equivalence Properties

Given the

equivalentId

and

canonicalId

properties are generated by

DID methods

themselves, the same security and
accuracy guarantees that apply to the resolved

DID

present in the

id

field of a

DID document

also apply to these properties.
The

alsoKnownAs

property is not guaranteed to be an accurate
statement of equivalence, and should not be relied upon without performing
validation steps beyond the resolution of the

DID document

.

The

equivalentId

and

canonicalId

properties express equivalence assertions to variants of a single

DID

produced by the same

DID method

and can be trusted to the extent the
requesting party trusts the

DID method

and a conforming producer and
resolver.

The

alsoKnownAs

property permits an equivalence assertion to

URIs

that are not governed by the same

DID method

and cannot be
trusted without performing verification steps outside of the governing

DID
method

. See additional guidance in

5.1.3

Also Known As

.

As with any other security-related properties in the

DID document

,
parties relying on any equivalence statement in a

DID document

should
guard against the values of these properties being substituted by an attacker
after the proper verification has been performed. Any write access to a

DID
document

stored in memory or disk after verification has been performed is
an attack vector that might circumvent verification unless the

DID
document

is re-verified.

9.15

Content Integrity Protection

DID documents

which include links to external machine-readable content
such as images, web pages, or schemas are vulnerable to tampering. It is
strongly advised that external links are integrity protected using solutions
such as a hashlink [

HASHLINK

]. External links are to be avoided if they
cannot be integrity protected and the

DID document

's integrity is
dependent on the external link.

One example of an external link where the integrity of the

DID document

itself could be affected is the JSON-LD Context [

JSON-LD11

]. To protect
against compromise,

DID document

consumers are advised to cache local
static copies of JSON-LD contexts and/or verify the integrity of external
contexts against a cryptographic hash that is known to be associated with a safe
version of the external JSON-LD Context.

9.16

Persistence

DIDs

are designed to be persistent such that a

controller

need not
rely upon a single trusted third party or administrator to maintain their
identifiers. In an ideal case, no administrator can take control away from the

controller

, nor can an administrator prevent their identifiers' use for
any particular purpose such as authentication, authorization, and attestation.
No third party can act on behalf of a

controller

to remove or render
inoperable an entity's identifier without the

controller

's consent.

However, it is important to note that in all

DID methods

that enable
cryptographic proof-of-control, the means of proving control can always be
transferred to another party by transferring the secret cryptographic material.
Therefore, it is vital that systems relying on the persistence of an identifier
over time regularly check to ensure that the identifier is, in fact, still under
the control of the intended party.

Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine from the cryptography alone whether
or not the secret cryptographic material associated with a given

verification method

has been compromised. It might well be that the
expected

controller

still has access to the secret cryptographic material
— and as such can execute a proof-of-control as part of a verification
process — while at the same time, a bad actor also has access to those
same keys, or to a copy thereof.

As such, cryptographic proof-of-control is expected to only be used as one
factor in evaluating the level of identity assurance required for high-stakes
scenarios.

DID

-based authentication provides much greater assurance than
a username and password, thanks to the ability to determine control over a
cryptographic secret without transmitting that secret between systems. However,
it is not infallible. Scenarios that involve sensitive, high value, or
life-critical operations are expected to use additional factors as appropriate.

In addition to potential ambiguity from use by different

controllers

, it
is impossible to guarantee, in general, that a given

DID

is being used in
reference to the same subject at any given point in time. It is technically
possible for the controller to reuse a

DID

for different subjects and,
more subtly, for the precise definition of the subject to either change over
time or be misunderstood.

For example, consider a

DID

used for a sole proprietorship, receiving
various credentials used for financial transactions. To the

controller

,
that identifier referred to the business. As the business grows, it eventually
gets incorporated as a Limited Liability Company. The

controller

continues using that same

DID

, because to

them

the

DID

refers to the business. However, to the state, the tax authority, and
the local municipality, the

DID

no longer refers to the same entity.
Whether or not the subtle shift in meaning matters to a credit provider or
supplier is necessarily up to them to decide. In many cases, as long as the
bills get paid and collections can be enforced, the shift is immaterial.

Due to these potential ambiguities,

DIDs

are to be considered valid

contextually

rather than absolutely. Their persistence does not imply
that they refer to the exact same subject, nor that they are under the control
of the same

controller

. Instead, one needs to understand the context in
which the

DID

was created, how it is used, and consider the likely shifts
in their meaning, and adopt procedures and policies to address both potential
and inevitable semantic drift.

9.17

Level of Assurance

Additional information about the security context of authentication events is
often required for compliance reasons, especially in regulated areas such as the
financial and public sectors. This information is often referred to as a Level
of Assurance (LOA). Examples include the protection of secret cryptographic
material, the identity proofing process, and the form-factor of the
authenticator.

Payment services (PSD 2)

and

eIDAS

introduce such requirements to the security context. Level of
assurance frameworks are classified and defined by regulations and
standards such as

eIDAS

,

NIST 800-63-3

and

ISO/IEC
29115:2013

, including their requirements for the security context, and
making recommendations on how to achieve them. This might include strong user
authentication where

FIDO2

/

WebAuthn

can fulfill the
requirement.

Some regulated scenarios require the implementation of a specific level of
assurance. Since

verification relationships

such as

assertionMethod

and

authentication

might be
used in some of these situations, information about the applied security context
might need to be expressed and provided to a

verifier

. Whether and how
to encode this information in the

DID document

data model is out of scope
for this specification. Interested readers might note that 1) the information
could be transmitted using Verifiable Credentials [

VC-DATA-MODEL

], and 2) the

DID document

data model can be extended to incorporate this information
as described in

4.1

Extensibility

, and where

10.

Privacy Considerations

is applicable for such extensions.

10.

Privacy Considerations

This section is non-normative.

Since

DIDs

and

DID documents

are designed to be administered
directly by the

DID controller(s)

, it is critically important to apply
the principles of Privacy by Design [

PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN

] to all aspects of the

decentralized identifier

architecture. All seven of these principles
have been applied throughout the development of this specification. The design
used in this specification does not assume that there is a registrar, hosting
company, nor other intermediate service provider to recommend or apply
additional privacy safeguards. Privacy in this specification is preventive,
not remedial, and is an embedded default. The following sections cover privacy
considerations that implementers might find useful when building systems that
utilize

decentralized identifiers

.

10.1

Keep Personal Data Private

If a

DID method

specification is written for a public-facing

verifiable data registry

where corresponding

DIDs

and

DID
documents

might be made publicly available, it is

critical

that
those

DID documents

contain no personal data. Personal data can instead
be transmitted through other means such as 1) Verifiable Credentials
[

VC-DATA-MODEL

], or 2)

service endpoints

under control of the

DID
subject

or

DID controller

.

Due diligence is expected to be taken around the use of URLs in

service
endpoints

to prevent leakage of personal data or correlation within a URL of
a

service endpoint

. For example, a URL that contains a username is
dangerous to include in a

DID Document

because the username is likely to
be human-meaningful in a way that can reveal information that the

DID
subject

did not consent to sharing. With the privacy architecture suggested
by this specification, personal data can be exchanged on a private, peer-to-peer
basis using communication channels identified and secured by

verification
methods

in

DID documents

. This also enables

DID subjects

and
requesting parties to implement the

GDPR

right to be
forgotten

, because no personal data is written to an immutable

distributed ledger

.

10.2

DID Correlation Risks

Like any type of globally unambiguous identifier,

DIDs

might be used for
correlation.

DID controllers

can mitigate this privacy risk by using
pairwise

DIDs

that are unique to each relationship; in effect, each

DID

acts as a pseudonym. A pairwise

DID

need only be shared with
more than one party when correlation is explicitly desired. If pairwise

DIDs

are the default, then the only need to publish a

DID

openly,
or to share it with multiple parties, is when the

DID controller(s)

and/or

DID subject

explicitly desires public identification and correlation.

10.3

DID Document Correlation Risks

The anti-correlation protections of pairwise

DIDs

are easily defeated if
the data in the corresponding

DID documents

can be correlated. For
example, using identical

verification methods

or bespoke

service
endpoints

in multiple

DID documents

can provide as much correlation
information as using the same

DID

. Therefore, the

DID document

for
a pairwise

DID

also needs to use pairwise unique information, such as
ensuring that

verification methods

are unique to the pairwise
relationship.

It might seem natural to also use pairwise unique

service endpoints

in
the

DID document

for a pairwise

DID

. However, unique endpoints
allow all traffic between two

DIDs

to be isolated perfectly into unique
buckets, where timing correlation and similar analysis is easy. Therefore, a
better strategy for endpoint privacy might be to share an endpoint among a large
number of

DIDs

controlled by many different subjects (see

10.5

Herd Privacy

).

10.4

DID Subject Classification

It is dangerous to add properties to the

DID document

that can be used
to indicate, explicitly or through inference, what

type

or nature of
thing the

DID subject

is, particularly if the

DID subject

is a
person.

Not only do such properties potentially result in personal data (see

10.1

Keep Personal Data Private

) or
correlatable data (see

10.2

DID Correlation Risks

and

10.3

DID Document Correlation Risks

) being present in the

DID document

, but they can be used for grouping particular

DIDs

in such a way that they are included in or excluded from certain operations or
functionalities.

Including

type

information in a

DID Document

can
result in personal privacy harms even for

DID Subjects

that are
non-person entities, such as IoT devices. The aggregation of such
information around a

DID Controller

could serve as a form of
digital fingerprint and this is best avoided.

To minimize these risks, all properties in a

DID document

ought to be
for expressing cryptographic material, endpoints, or

verification methods

related to using the

DID

.

10.5

Herd Privacy

When a

DID subject

is indistinguishable from others in the herd,
privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is
by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished.

DIDs

and

DID
methods

need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who
legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that
default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce

digital
fingerprints

, share common settings across requesting party
implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use
encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to standard lengths.

10.6

Service Privacy

The ability for a

controller

to optionally express at least one

service endpoint

in the

DID document

increases their control and
agency. Each additional endpoint in the

DID document

adds privacy risk
either due to correlation, such as across endpoint descriptions, or because the

services

are not protected by an authorization mechanism, or both.

DID documents

are often public and, since they are standardized, will be
stored and indexed efficiently by their very standards-based nature. This risk
is worse if

DID documents

are published to immutable

verifiable data
registries

. Access to a history of the

DID documents

referenced by a

DID

represents a form of traffic analysis made more efficient through the
use of standards.

The degree of additional privacy risk caused by using multiple

service
endpoints

in one

DID document

can be difficult to estimate. Privacy
harms are typically unintended consequences.

DIDs

can refer to documents,

services

, schemas, and other things that might be associated with
individual people, households, clubs, and employers — and correlation of
their

service endpoints

could become a powerful surveillance and
inference tool. An example of this potential harm can be seen when multiple
common country-level top level domains such as

https://example.co.uk

might be used to infer the approximate
location of the

DID subject

with a greater degree of probability.

Maintaining Herd Privacy

The variety of possible endpoints makes it particularly challenging to maintain
herd privacy, in which no information about the

DID subject

is leaked
(see

10.5

Herd Privacy

).

First, because service endpoints might be specified as

URIs

, they could
unintentionally leak personal information because of the architecture of the
service. For example, a service endpoint of

http://example.com/MyFirstName

is leaking the term

MyFirstName

to everyone who can access the

DID document

.
When linking to legacy systems, this is an unavoidable risk, and care is
expected to be taken in such cases. This specification encourages new,

DID

-aware endpoints to use nothing more than the

DID

itself for
any identification necessary. For example, if a service description were to
include

http://example.com/did%3Aexample%3Aabc123

, no harm would be
done because

did:example:abc123

is already exposed in the DID
Document; it leaks no additional information.

Second, because a

DID document

can list multiple service endpoints, it is
possible to irreversibly associate services that are not associated in any other
context. This correlation on its own may lead to privacy harms by revealing
information about the

DID subject

, even if the

URIs

used did not
contain any sensitive information.

Third, because some types of

DID subjects

might be more or less likely to
list specific endpoints, the listing of a given service could, by itself, leak
information that can be used to infer something about the

DID subject

.
For example, a

DID

for an automobile might include a pointer to a public
title record at the Department of Motor Vehicles, while a

DID

for an
individual would not include that information.

It is the goal of herd privacy to ensure that the nature of specific

DID
subjects

is obscured by the population of the whole. To maximize herd
privacy, implementers need to rely on one — and only one — service
endpoint, with that endpoint providing a proxy or mediator service that the
controller is willing to depend on, to protect such associations and to blind
requests to the ultimate service.

Service Endpoint Alternatives

Given the concerns in the previous section, implementers are urged to
consider any of the following service endpoint approaches:

Negotiator Endpoint

— Service for negotiating mutually
agreeable communications channels, preferably using private set intersection.
The output of negotiation is a communication channel and whatever credentials
might be needed to access it.

Tor Endpoint

(

Tor Onion Router

) —
Provide a privacy-respecting address for reaching service endpoints. Any service
that can be provided online can be provided through TOR for additional
privacy.

Mediator Endpoint

—

Mediators

provide a generic endpoint, for multiple parties, receive encrypted messages on
behalf of those parties, and forward them to the intended recipient. This avoids
the need to have a specific endpoint per subject, which could create a
correlation risk. This approach is also called a proxy.

Confidential Storage

— Proprietary or confidential
personal information might need to be kept off of a

verifiable data
registry

to provide additional privacy and/or security guarantees,
especially for those

DID methods

where

DID documents

are published
on a public ledger. Pointing to external resource services provides a means for
authorization checks and deletion.

Polymorphic Proxy

— A proxy endpoint that can act as any
number of services, depending on how it is called. For example, the same URL
could be used for both negotiator and mediator functions, depending on a
mechanism for re-routing.

These service endpoint types continue to be an area of innovation and
exploration.

Methods

, and

Resolution

Detailed overview of DID architecture and the relationship of the basic components.

B.2

Creation of a DID

The creation of a

DID

is a process that is defined by each

DID
Method

. Some

DID Methods

, such as

did:key

, are purely
generative, such that a

DID

and a

DID document

are generated by
transforming a single piece of cryptographic material into a conformant

representation

. Other

DID methods

might require the use of a

verifiable data registry

, where the

DID

and

DID document

are recognized to exist by third parties only when the registration has been
completed, as defined by the respective

DID method

. Other processes
might be defined by the respective

DID method

.

B.3

Determining the DID subject

A

DID

is a specific type of URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), so a

DID

can refer to any resource. Per [

RFC3986

]:

the term "resource" is used in a general sense for whatever might be
identified by a URI. [...] A resource is not necessarily
accessible via the Internet.

Resources can be digital or physical, abstract or concrete. Any resource that
can be assigned a URI can be assigned a

DID

. The resource referred to
by the

DID

is the

DID subject

.

The

DID controller

determines the

DID subject

.
It is not expected to be possible to determine the

DID subject

from looking at the

DID

itself, as

DIDs

are generally
only meaningful to machines, not human. A

DID

is unlikely to contain
any information about the

DID subject

, so further information
about the

DID subject

is only discoverable by resolving the

DID

to the

DID document

, obtaining a verifiable credential about the

DID

, or via some other description of the

DID

.

While the value of the

id

property in the retrieved

DID document

must always match the

DID

being resolved, whether
or not the actual resource to which the

DID

refers can change over time
is dependent upon the

DID method

. For example, a

DID method

that permits the

DID subject

to change could be used to generate a

DID

for the current occupant of a particular role—such as the CEO
of a company—where the actual person occupying the role can be different
depending on when the

DID

is resolved.

B.4

Referring to the DID document

The

DID

refers to the

DID subject

and

resolves to

the

DID document

(by following the protocol specified by the

DID method

). The

DID document

is not a separate resource from
the

DID subject

and does not have a

URI

separate from the

DID

. Rather the

DID document

is an artifact of

DID
resolution

controlled by the

DID controller

for the purpose of
describing the

DID subject

.

This distinction is illustrated by the graph model shown below.

Figure

A

is an identifier assigned by a

DID controller

to refer to
a

DID subject

and resolve to a

DID document

that describes the

Two filled black circles appear at the top of the diagram, one on the left,
labeled "DID Controller", and one on the right, labeled "DID Subject". A
rectangle, with lower right corner bent inwards to form a small triangle,
appears below, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows extend between these
three items, as follows. A solid red arrow points directly from the DID
Controller circle, rightwards to the DID Subject circle, labeled "DID" above it
in large font, and "Identifies" below it in small italic font. The other arrow
labels are also in small italic font. A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves
to", extends from DID Controller, starting in the same line as the first arrow,
then curving downward to point to the DID Document rectangle. A green arrow,
labeled "Controls", points directly from DID Controller to DID Document. A
green arrow labeled "Controller" points in the opposite direction, from DID
Document to DID Controller, making an arc outward to the left of the diagram. A
blue arrow, labeled, "Describes" points directly from DID Document to DID
Subject.

B.5

Statements in the DID document

Each property in a

DID document

is a statement by the

DID controller

that describes:

The string of characters defining identifiers for the

DID subject

(e.g., the

id

and

alsoKnownAs

properties)

How to interact with the

DID subject

(e.g., the

verificationMethod

and

service

properties).

How to interpret the specific representation of the

DID document

(e.g., the

@context

property for a JSON-LD representation).

The only required property in a

DID document

is

id

,
so that is the only statement guaranteed to be in a

DID document

.
That statement is illustrated in

Figure

8

with a direct link between the

DID

and the

DID subject

.

B.6

Discovering more information about the DID subject

Options for discovering more information about the

DID subject

depend
on the properties present in the

DID document

. If the

service

property is present, more information can be
requested from a

service endpoint

. For example, by querying a

service endpoint

that supports verifiable credentials for one or more
claims (attributes) describing the

DID subject

.

Another option is to use the

alsoKnownAs

property if it
is present in the

DID document

. The

DID controller

can use it
to provide a list of other URIs (including other

DIDs

) that refer to
the same

DID subject

. Resolving or dereferencing these URIs might yield
other descriptions or representations of the

DID subject

as
illustrated in the figure below.

Figure

9

A

DID document

can use the alsoKnownAs property to assert that another

URI

(including, but not necessarily, another

DID

) refers to the
same

DID subject

. See also:

narrative description

.

The diagram contains three small black filled circles, two rectangles with bent
corners, arrows between them, and labels, as follows. On the upper left is a
circle labeled "DID Controller". On the upper right is a circle labeled "DID
Subject". On the lower-middle right is a circle without a label. On the lower
right is a rectangle labeled "Description". In the center of the diagram is a
rectangle labeled "DID Document". Inside the DID Document rectangle, beneath
its label, is two lines of code: "alsoKnownAs: [", and "URI]". A black arrow
extends from the second line, to the right, crossing the rectangle border,
pointing to the unlabeled circle at the right of the diagram. This arrow is
labeled above it in large font, "URI", and below it in italic, "Identifies". A
black arrow points from the unlabeled circle downwards to the Description
rectangle, labeled "Dereferences to". A blue arrow, labeled "Describes",
extends from Description, arcing on the right, pointing up to DID Subject. A
blue arrow, also labeled "Describes", points directly from the rectangle,
labeled "DID Document", in the center of the diagram, up and to the right to the
DID Subject circle. A red arrow, labeled "alsoKnownAs", points from DID Subject
down to the unlabeled circle. A red arrow, labeled "DID" above it in large font,
and "Identifies" below it in italic font, lies at the top of the image, pointing
from DID Controller to DID Subject. A dotted red line starts in the same place
but branches off and curves downward to point to the DID Document rectangle at
the center of the image. A green arrow, labeled "Controls", points directly
from DID Controller to DID Document. Another green arrow points in the opposite
direction, labeled "Controller", curving outwards on the left of the image,
from DID Document to DID Controller.

B.7

Serving a representation of the DID subject

If the

DID subject

is a digital resource that can be retrieved
from the internet, a

DID method

can choose to construct a

DID URL

which returns a representation of the

DID subject

itself. For example,
a data schema that needs a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier
could be assigned a

DID

, and passing a specified DID parameter (see

3.2.1

DID Parameters

) could be used as a standard way to retrieve a
representation of that schema.

Similarly, a

DID

can be used to refer to a digital resource (such as
an image) that can be returned directly from a

verifiable data registry

if that functionality is supported by the applicable

DID method

.

B.8

Assigning DIDs to existing web resources

If the controller of a web page or any other web resource wants to
assign it a persistent, cryptographically verifiable identifier, the
controller can give it a

DID

. For example, the author of a blog
hosted by a blog hosting company (under that hosting company's domain)
could create a

DID

for the blog. In the

DID document

, the
author can include the

alsoKnownAs

property pointing to
the current URL of the blog, e.g.:

"alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.blogging-host.example/home"]

If the author subsequently moves the blog to a different hosting company
(or to the author's own domain), the author can update the

DID document

to point to the new URL for the blog, e.g.:

"alsoKnownAs": ["https://myblog.example/"]

The

DID

effectively adds a layer of indirection for the blog URL. This
layer of indirection is under the control of the author instead of under the
control of an external administrative authority such as the blog hosting
company. This is how a

DID

can effectively function as an enhanced

URN (Uniform Resource
Name)

—a persistent identifier for an information resource whose
network location might change over time.

B.9

The relationship between DID controllers and DID subjects

To avoid confusion, it is helpful to classify

DID subject

s into two disjoint sets based on their relationship to
the

DID controller

.

B.9.1

Set #1: The DID subject

is

the DID controller

The first case, shown in

Figure

10

, is
the common scenario where the

DID subject

is also the

DID
controller

. This is the case when an individual or organization creates a

DID

to self-identify.

Figure

10

The

DID subject

is the same entity as the

DID controller

. See
also:

narrative description

.

Two small black circles appear in the diagram, one on the upper left, labeled,
"DID Controller", and one on the upper right, labeled "DID Subject". A solid red
arrow extends from the DID Controller circle to the DID Subject circle, labeled
"DID" in large bold text above the arrow, and "Identifies" in small italic text
beneath the arrow. A dotted red double-ended arrow, labeled "Equivalence",
extends between the two circles, forming an arc in the space between and above
them. In the lower part of the diagram is a rectangle with bent corner, outlined
in black, containing the label "DID Document". Arrows point between this DID
Document rectangle and the small black circles for DID Controller and DID
Subject, with italic labels, as follows. A blue arrow points from the DID
Document to the DID Subject, labeled, "Describes". A green arrow points from the
DID Controller to the DID Document, labeled "Controls". A green arrow points
from the DID Document to the DID Controller, in an outward arc, labeled,
"Controller". A dotted red arrow, labeled "Resolves to", extends from the DID
controller starting to the right, branching off from the arrow to the DID
Subject, then curving downward to point to the DID Document.

From a graph model perspective, even though the nodes identified as the

DID controller

and

DID subject

in

Figure

10

are distinct, there is a
logical arc connecting them to express a semantic equivalence relationship.

B.9.2

Set #2: The DID subject is

not

the DID controller

The second case is when the

DID subject

is a separate entity from the

DID controller

. This is the case when, for example, a parent creates
and maintains control of a

DID

for a child; a corporation creates and
maintains control of a

DID

for a subsidiary; or a manufacturer
creates and maintains control of a

DID

for a product, an IoT device,
or a digital file.

From a graph model perspective, the only difference from Set 1 that there is
no equivalence arc relationship between the

DID subject

and

DID controller

nodes.

B.10

Multiple DID controllers

A

DID document

might have more than one

DID controller

. This can
happen in one of two ways.

B.10.1

Independent Control

In this case, each of the

DID controllers

might act on its own, i.e.,
each one has full power to update the

DID document

independently. From
a graph model perspective, in this configuration:

Each additional

DID controller

is another distinct graph node
(which might be identified by its own

DID

).

The same arcs ("controls" and "controller") exist between each

DID controller

and the

DID document

.

Figure

11

Multiple independent

DID controllers

that can each act independently. See
also:

Text
Description

Three black circles appear on the left, vertically, each labeled "DID
Controller". From each of these circles, a pair of green arrows extends towards
the center of the diagram, to a single rectangle, labeled "DID Document". The
rectangle has the lower right corner cut and bent inward to form a small
triangle, as if to represent a physical piece of paper with curled corner. Each
pair of green arrows consists of one arrow pointing from the black circle to the
rectangle, labeled "Controls", and one pointing in the opposite direction, from
the rectangle to the black circle, labeled "Controller". From the right of the
rectangle extends a blue arrow, labeled, "Describes", pointing to a black circle
labeled, "DID Subject".

B.10.2

Group Control

In the case of group control, the

DID controllers

are expected to act
together in some fashion, such as when using a cryptographic algorithm that
requires multiple digital signatures ("multi-sig") or a threshold number of
digital signatures ("m-of-n"). From a functional standpoint, this option is
similar to a single

DID controller

because, although each of the

DID controllers

in the

DID controller

group has its own graph
node, the actual control collapses into a single logical graph node
representing the

DID controller

group as shown in

Figure

12

.

Figure

12

Multiple

DID controllers

who are expected to act together as a

DID
controller

group. See also:

narrative description

.

On the left are three black filled circles, labeled "DID Controller Group" by a
brace on the left. From each of these three circles, a green arrow extends to
the center right. These three arrows converge towards a single filled white
circle. A pair of horizontal green arrows connects this white circle on its
right to a rectangle shaped like a page with a curled corner, labeled "DID
Document". The upper arrow points right, from the white circle to the
rectangle, and is labeled "Controls". The lower arrow points left, from the
rectangle to the white circle, and is labeled "Controller". From the right of
the rectangle extends a blue arrow, labeled "Describes", pointing to a black
circle, labeled "DID Subject".

This configuration will often apply when the

DID subject

is an
organization, corporation, government agency, community, or other group
that is not controlled by a single individual.

B.11

Changing the DID subject

A

DID document

has exactly one

DID

which refers to
the

DID subject

. The

DID

is expressed as the value of the

id

property. This property value is immutable for
the lifetime of the

DID document

.

However, it is possible that the resource

identified

by the

DID

,
the

DID subject

, may change over time. This is under the exclusive
authority of the

DID controller

. For more details, see section

9.16

Persistence

.

B.12

Changing the DID controller

The

DID controller

for a

DID document

might change over time.
However, depending on how it is implemented, a change in the

DID
controller

might not be made apparent by changes to the

DID document

itself. For example, if the change is implemented through a shift in ownership
of the underlying cryptographic keys or other controls used for one or more of
the

verification methods

in the

DID document

, it might be
indistinguishable from a standard key rotation.

On the other hand, if the change is implemented by changing the value of the

controller

property, it will be transparent.

If it is important to verify a change of

DID controller

, implementers are
advised to

authenticate

the new

DID controller

against the

verification methods

in the revised

DID document

.

C.

.

Clarification that

equivalentId

and

canonicalId

are optional.

Replacement of

publicKeyBase58

with

publicKeyMultibase

.

Updates to the DID Document examples section.

A large number of editorial clean ups to the Security Considerations section.

Changes since the

First Public Working
Draft

include:

The introduction of an abstract data model that can be serialized to multiple
representations including JSON and JSON-LD.

The introduction of a DID Specifications Registry for the purposes of
registering extension properties, representations, DID Resolution input
metadata and output metadata, DID Document metadata, DID parameters, and DID
Methods.

Separation of DID Document metadata, such as created and updated values,
from DID Document properties.

The removal of embedded proofs in the DID Document.

The addition of verification relationships for the purposes of authentication,
assertion, key agreement, capability invocation and capability delegation.

The ability to support relating multiple identifiers with the DID Document,
such as the DID controller, also known as, equivalent IDs, and canonical IDs.

Enhancing privacy by reducing information that could contain personally
identifiable information in the DID Document.

The addition of a large section on security considerations and privacy
considerations.

A Representations section that details how the abstract data model can be
produced and consumed in a variety of different formats along with general
rules for all representations, producers, and consumers.

A section detailing the DID Resolution and DID URL Dereferencing interface
definition that all DID resolvers are expected to expose as well as inputs
and outputs to those processes.

DID Document examples in an appendix that provide more complex examples of
DID Document serializations.

IANA Considerations for multiple representations specified in DID Core.

Removal of the Future Work section as much of the work has now been
accomplished.

An acknowledgements section.

Acknowledgements

The Working Group extends deep appreciation and heartfelt thanks to our Chairs
Brent Zundel and Dan Burnett, as well as our

W3C

Staff Contact, Ivan Herman, for
their tireless work in keeping the Working Group headed in a productive
direction and navigating the deep and dangerous waters of the standards process.

The Working Group gratefully acknowledges the work that led to the creation of
this specification, and extends sincere appreciation to those individuals that
worked on technologies and specifications that deeply influenced our work. In
particular, this includes the work of Phil Zimmerman, Jon Callas, Lutz
Donnerhacke, Hal Finney, David Shaw, and Rodney Thayer on

Pretty Good Privacy
(PGP)

in the 1990s and 2000s.

In the mid-2010s, preliminary implementations of what would become Decentralized
Identifiers were

built

in collaboration with Jeremie Miller's Telehash project and the

W3C

Web Payments Community Group's work led by Dave Longley and Manu Sporny. Around
a year later, the XDI.org Registry Working Group

began exploring

decentralized technologies for replacing its existing
identifier registry. Some of the first

written

papers

exploring the concept of Decentralized Identifiers can be traced back to the
first several Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops convened by Christopher
Allen. That work led to a key collaboration between Christopher Allen, Drummond
Reed, Les Chasen, Manu Sporny, and Anil John. Anil saw promise in the technology
and allocated the initial set of government funding to explore the space.
Without the support of Anil John and his guidance through the years, it is
unlikely that Decentralized Identifiers would be where they are today. Further
refinement at the Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops led to the

first
implementers documentation

, edited by Drummond Reed, Les Chasen, Christopher
Allen, and Ryan Grant. Contributors included Manu Sporny, Dave Longley, Jason
Law, Daniel Hardman, Markus Sabadello, Christian Lundkvist, and Jonathan
Endersby. This initial work was then merged into the

W3C

Credentials Community
Group, incubated further, and then transitioned to the

W3C

Decentralized
Identifiers Working Group for global standardization.

Portions of the work on this specification have been funded by the United States
Department of Homeland Security's (US DHS) Science and Technology Directorate
under contracts HSHQDC-16-R00012-H-SB2016-1-002, and HSHQDC-17-C-00019, as well
as the US DHS Silicon Valley Innovation Program under contracts

not necessarily reflect the position or the policy of the U.S. Government and no
official endorsement should be inferred.

Portions of the work on this specification have also been funded by the European
Union's StandICT.eu program under sub-grantee contract number CALL05/19. The
content of this specification does not necessarily reflect the position or the
policy of the European Union and no official endorsement should be inferred.

Rebooting the Web of Trust

community
facilitated by Christopher Allen, Shannon Appelcline, Kiara Robles, Brian
Weller, Betty Dhamers, Kaliya Young, Kim Hamilton Duffy, Manu Sporny, Drummond
Reed, Joe Andrieu, and Heather Vescent. Development of this specification has
also been supported by the

W3C

Credentials
Community Group

, which has been Chaired by Kim Hamilton Duffy, Joe Andrieu,
Christopher Allen, Heather Vescent, and Wayne Chang. The participants in the
Internet Identity Workshop, facilitated by Phil Windley, Kaliya Young, Doc
Searls, and Heidi Nobantu Saul, also supported this work through numerous
working sessions designed to debate, improve, and educate participants about
this specification.
